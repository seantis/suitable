        .. seealso::
            :ref:`ansible.builtin <ansible_collections.ansible.builtin.apt_module>`

        :param name:
            A list of package names, like `foo`, or package specifier with
            version, like `foo=1.0` or `foo>=1.0`. Name wildcards (fnmatch)
            like `apt*` and version wildcards like `foo=1.0*` are also
            supported.
        :param state:
            Indicates the desired package state. `latest` ensures that the
            latest version is installed. `build-dep` ensures the package build
            dependencies are installed. `fixed` attempt to correct a system
            with broken dependencies in place.
        :param update_cache:
            Run the equivalent of `apt-get update` before the operation. Can
            be run as part of the package installation or as a separate step.
            Default is not to update the cache.
        :param update_cache_retries:
            Amount of retries if the cache update fails. Also see
            `update_cache_retry_max_delay`.
        :param update_cache_retry_max_delay:
            Use an exponential backoff delay for each retry (see
            `update_cache_retries`) up to this max delay in seconds.
        :param cache_valid_time:
            Update the apt cache if it is older than the `cache_valid_time`.
            This option is set in seconds.
            As of Ansible 2.4, if explicitly set, this sets `update_cache=yes`.
        :param purge:
            Will force purging of configuration files if `state=absent` or
            `autoremove=yes`.
        :param default_release:
            Corresponds to the `-t` option for *apt* and sets pin priorities.
        :param install_recommends:
            Corresponds to the `--no-install-recommends` option for *apt*.
            `true` installs recommended packages. `false` does not install
            recommended packages. By default, Ansible will use the same
            defaults as the operating system. Suggested packages are never
            installed.
        :param force:
            Corresponds to the `--force-yes` to *apt-get* and implies
            `allow_unauthenticated=yes` and `allow_downgrade=yes`.
            This option will disable checking both the packages' signatures
            and the certificates of the web servers they are downloaded from.
            This option *is not* the equivalent of passing the `-f` flag to
            *apt-get* on the command line.
            **This is a destructive operation with the potential to destroy
            your system, and it should almost never be used.** Please also see
            `man apt-get` for more information.
        :param clean:
            Run the equivalent of `apt-get clean` to clear out the local
            repository of retrieved package files. It removes everything but
            the lock file from /var/cache/apt/archives/ and
            /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/.
            Can be run as part of the package installation (clean runs before
            install) or as a separate step.
        :param allow_unauthenticated:
            Ignore if packages cannot be authenticated. This is useful for
            bootstrapping environments that manage their own apt-key setup.
            `allow_unauthenticated` is only supported with `state`:
            `install`/`present`.
        :param allow_downgrade:
            Corresponds to the `--allow-downgrades` option for *apt*.
            This option enables the named package and version to replace an
            already installed higher version of that package.
            Note that setting `allow_downgrade=true` can make this module
            behave in a non-idempotent way.
            (The task could end up with a set of packages that does not match
            the complete list of specified packages to install).
            `allow_downgrade` is only supported by `apt` and will be ignored
            if `aptitude` is detected or specified.
        :param allow_change_held_packages:
            Allows changing the version of a package which is on the apt hold
            list.
        :param upgrade:
            If yes or safe, performs an aptitude safe-upgrade.
            If full, performs an aptitude full-upgrade.
            If dist, performs an apt-get dist-upgrade.
            Note: This does not upgrade a specific package, use state=latest
            for that.
            Note: Since 2.4, apt-get is used as a fall-back if aptitude is not
            present.
        :param dpkg_options:
            Add dpkg options to apt command. Defaults to '-o
            "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confdef" -o
            "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confold"'.
            Options should be supplied as comma separated list.
        :param deb:
            Path to a .deb package on the remote machine.
            If :// in the path, ansible will attempt to download deb before
            installing. (Version added 2.1).
            Requires the `xz-utils` package to extract the control file of the
            deb package to install.
        :param autoremove:
            If `true`, remove unused dependency packages for all module states
            except `build-dep`. It can also be used as the only option.
            Previous to version 2.4, autoclean was also an alias for
            autoremove, now it is its own separate command. See documentation
            for further information.
        :param autoclean:
            If `true`, cleans the local repository of retrieved package files
            that can no longer be downloaded.
        :param policy_rc_d:
            Force the exit code of /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d.
            For example, if *policy_rc_d=101* the installed package will not
            trigger a service start.
            If /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d already exists, it is backed up and
            restored after the package installation.
            If `null`, the /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d isn't created/changed.
        :param only_upgrade:
            Only upgrade a package if it is already installed.
        :param fail_on_autoremove:
            Corresponds to the `--no-remove` option for `apt`.
            If `true`, it is ensured that no packages will be removed or the
            task will fail.
            `fail_on_autoremove` is only supported with `state` except
            `absent`.
            `fail_on_autoremove` is only supported by `apt` and will be
            ignored if `aptitude` is detected or specified.
        :param force_apt_get:
            Force usage of apt-get instead of aptitude.
        :param lock_timeout:
            How many seconds will this action wait to acquire a lock on the
            apt db.
            Sometimes there is a transitory lock and this will retry at least
            until timeout is hit.

            A boolean that controls if files that start with a '.' will be
            included or not.
        :param validate:
            The validation command to run before copying into place.
            The path to the file to validate is passed in via '%s' which must
            be present as in the sshd example below.
            The command is passed securely so shell features like expansion
            and pipes won't work.
        :param decrypt:
            This option controls the auto-decryption of source files using
            vault.
        :param mode:
            The permissions the resulting filesystem object should have.
            For those used to */usr/bin/chmod* remember that modes are
            actually octal numbers. You must give Ansible enough information
            to parse them correctly. For consistent results, quote octal
            numbers (for example, `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a
            string and can do its own conversion from string into number.
            Adding a leading zero (for example, `0755`) works sometimes, but
            can fail in loops and some other circumstances.
            Giving Ansible a number without following either of these rules
            will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected
            results.
            As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode
            (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`).
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does not** exist, the default `umask` on the system will be used
            when setting the mode for the newly created filesystem object.
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does** exist, the mode of the existing filesystem object will be
            used.
            Specifying `mode` is the best way to ensure filesystem objects are
            created with the correct permissions. See CVE-2020-1736 for
            further details.
        :param owner:
            Name of the user that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current user unless you are
            root, in which case it can preserve the previous ownership.
            Specifying a numeric username will be assumed to be a user ID and
            not a username. Avoid numeric usernames to avoid this confusion.
        :param group:
            Name of the group that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current group of the current
            user unless you are root, in which case it can preserve the
            previous ownership.
        :param seuser:
            The user part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            By default it uses the `system` policy, where applicable.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `user` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param serole:
            The role part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `role` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param setype:
            The type part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param selevel:
            The level part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param unsafe_writes:
            Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption
            or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem object.
            By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data
            corruption or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem
            objects, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in
            ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted filesystem
            objects, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the
            container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
            This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of
            updating filesystem objects when atomic operations fail (however,
            it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).
            IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can
            lead to data corruption.
        :param attributes:
            The attributes the resulting filesystem object should have.
            To get supported flags look at the man page for *chattr* on the
            target system.
            This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the
            one displayed by *lsattr*.
            The `=` operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+` or `-`
            operators need to be included in the string.

        .. seealso::
            :ref:`ansible.builtin <ansible_collections.ansible.builtin.copy_module>`

        :param src:
            Local path to a file to copy to the remote server.
            This can be absolute or relative.
            If path is a directory, it is copied recursively. In this case, if
            path ends with "/", only inside contents of that directory are
            copied to destination. Otherwise, if it does not end with "/", the
            directory itself with all contents is copied. This behavior is
            similar to the `rsync` command line tool.
        :param content:
            When used instead of `src`, sets the contents of a file directly
            to the specified value.
            Works only when `dest` is a file. Creates the file if it does not
            exist.
            For advanced formatting or if `content` contains a variable, use
            the :meth:`ansible.builtin.template` module.
        :param dest:
            Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to.
            If `src` is a directory, this must be a directory too.
            If `dest` is a non-existent path and if either `dest` ends with
            "/" or `src` is a directory, `dest` is created.
            If `dest` is a relative path, the starting directory is determined
            by the remote host.
            If `src` and `dest` are files, the parent directory of `dest` is
            not created and the task fails if it does not already exist.
        :param backup:
            Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you
            can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it
            incorrectly.
        :param force:
            Influence whether the remote file must always be replaced.
            If `true`, the remote file will be replaced when contents are
            different than the source.
            If `false`, the file will only be transferred if the destination
            does not exist.
        :param mode:
            The permissions of the destination file or directory.
            For those used to `/usr/bin/chmod` remember that modes are
            actually octal numbers. You must either add a leading zero so that
            Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like `0644` or
            `01777`) or quote it (like `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible
            receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into
            number. Giving Ansible a number without following one of these
            rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected
            results.
            As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode
            (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`).
            As of Ansible 2.3, the mode may also be the special string
            `preserve`.
            `preserve` means that the file will be given the same permissions
            as the source file.
            When doing a recursive copy, see also `directory_mode`.
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination file **does not**
            exist, the default `umask` on the system will be used when setting
            the mode for the newly created file.
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination file **does**
            exist, the mode of the existing file will be used.
            Specifying `mode` is the best way to ensure files are created with
            the correct permissions. See CVE-2020-1736 for further details.
        :param directory_mode:
            Set the access permissions of newly created directories to the
            given mode. Permissions on existing directories do not change.
            See `mode` for the syntax of accepted values.
            The target system's defaults determine permissions when this
            parameter is not set.
        :param remote_src:
            Influence whether `src` needs to be transferred or already is
            present remotely.
            If `false`, it will search for `src` on the controller node.
            If `true` it will search for `src` on the managed (remote) node.
            `remote_src` supports recursive copying as of version 2.8.
            `remote_src` only works with `mode=preserve` as of version 2.6.
            Auto-decryption of files does not work when `remote_src=yes`.
        :param follow:
            This flag indicates that filesystem links in the destination, if
            they exist, should be followed.
        :param local_follow:
            This flag indicates that filesystem links in the source tree, if
            they exist, should be followed.
        :param checksum:
            SHA1 checksum of the file being transferred.
            Used to validate that the copy of the file was successful.
            If this is not provided, ansible will use the local calculated
            checksum of the src file.
        :param decrypt:
            This option controls the auto-decryption of source files using
            vault.
        :param owner:
            Name of the user that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current user unless you are
            root, in which case it can preserve the previous ownership.
            Specifying a numeric username will be assumed to be a user ID and
            not a username. Avoid numeric usernames to avoid this confusion.
        :param group:
            Name of the group that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current group of the current
            user unless you are root, in which case it can preserve the
            previous ownership.
        :param seuser:
            The user part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            By default it uses the `system` policy, where applicable.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `user` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param serole:
            The role part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `role` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param setype:
            The type part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param selevel:
            The level part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param unsafe_writes:
            Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption
            or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem object.
            By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data
            corruption or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem
            objects, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in
            ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted filesystem
            objects, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the
            container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
            This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of
            updating filesystem objects when atomic operations fail (however,
            it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).
            IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can
            lead to data corruption.
        :param attributes:
            The attributes the resulting filesystem object should have.
            To get supported flags look at the man page for *chattr* on the
            target system.
            This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the
            one displayed by *lsattr*.
            The `=` operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+` or `-`
            operators need to be included in the string.
        :param validate:
            The validation command to run before copying the updated file into
            the final destination.
            A temporary file path is used to validate, passed in through '%s'
            which must be present as in the examples below.
            Also, the command is passed securely so shell features such as
            expansion and pipes will not work.
            For an example on how to handle more complex validation than what
            this option provides, see `handling complex validation`.

            crontab. The assumption is that this file is exclusively managed
            by the module, do not use if the file contains multiple entries,
            NEVER use for /etc/crontab.
            If this is a relative path, it is interpreted with respect to
            `/etc/cron.d`.
            Many linux distros expect (and some require) the filename portion
            to consist solely of upper- and lower-case letters, digits,
            underscores, and hyphens.
            Using this parameter requires you to specify the `user` as well,
            unless `state` is not `present`.
            Either this parameter or `name` is required.
        :param backup:
            If set, create a backup of the crontab before it is modified. The
            location of the backup is returned in the `ignore:backup_file`
            variable by this module.

        :param name:
            A package name or package specifier with version, like `name-1.0`.
            When using state=latest, this can be '*' which means run: dnf -y
            update. You can also pass a url or a local path to an rpm file. To
            operate on several packages this can accept a comma separated
            string of packages or a list of packages.
            Comparison operators for package version are valid here `>`, `<`,
            `>=`, `<=`. Example - `name >= 1.0`. Spaces around the operator
            are required.
            You can also pass an absolute path for a binary which is provided
            by the package to install. See examples for more information.

            :meth:`ansible.builtin.package_facts` instead of the `list`
            argument as a best practice.
        :param state:
            Whether to install (`present`, `latest`), or remove (`absent`) a
            package.
            Default is `None`, however in effect the default action is
            `present` unless the `autoremove` option is enabled for this
            module, then `absent` is inferred.
        :param enablerepo:
            *Repoid* of repositories to enable for the install/update
            operation. These repos will not persist beyond the transaction.
            When specifying multiple repos, separate them with a ",".
        :param disablerepo:
            *Repoid* of repositories to disable for the install/update
            operation. These repos will not persist beyond the transaction.
            When specifying multiple repos, separate them with a ",".
        :param conf_file:
            The remote dnf configuration file to use for the transaction.
        :param disable_gpg_check:
            Whether to disable the GPG checking of signatures of packages
            being installed. Has an effect only if `state` is `present` or
            `latest`.
            This setting affects packages installed from a repository as well
            as "local" packages installed from the filesystem or a URL.
        :param installroot:
            Specifies an alternative installroot, relative to which all
            packages will be installed.
        :param releasever:
            Specifies an alternative release from which all packages will be
            installed.
        :param autoremove:
            If `true`, removes all "leaf" packages from the system that were
            originally installed as dependencies of user-installed packages
            but which are no longer required by any such package. Should be
            used alone or when `state` is `absent`.
        :param exclude:
            Package name(s) to exclude when state=present, or latest. This can
            be a list or a comma separated string.
        :param skip_broken:
            Skip all unavailable packages or packages with broken dependencies
            without raising an error. Equivalent to passing the --skip-broken
            option.
        :param update_cache:
            Force dnf to check if cache is out of date and redownload if
            needed. Has an effect only if `state` is `present` or `latest`.
        :param update_only:
            When using latest, only update installed packages. Do not install
            packages.
            Has an effect only if `state` is `latest`.
        :param security:
            If set to `true`, and `state=latest` then only installs updates
            that have been marked security related.
            Note that, similar to `dnf upgrade-minimal`, this filter applies
            to dependencies as well.
        :param bugfix:
            If set to `true`, and `state=latest` then only installs updates
            that have been marked bugfix related.
            Note that, similar to `dnf upgrade-minimal`, this filter applies
            to dependencies as well.
        :param enable_plugin:
            *Plugin* name to enable for the install/update operation. The
            enabled plugin will not persist beyond the transaction.
        :param disable_plugin:
            *Plugin* name to disable for the install/update operation. The
            disabled plugins will not persist beyond the transaction.
        :param disable_excludes:
            Disable the excludes defined in DNF config files.
            If set to `all`, disables all excludes.
            If set to `main`, disable excludes defined in [main] in dnf.conf.
            If set to `repoid`, disable excludes defined for given repo id.
        :param validate_certs:
            This only applies if using a https url as the source of the rpm.
            e.g. for localinstall. If set to `false`, the SSL certificates
            will not be validated.
            This should only set to `false` used on personally controlled
            sites using self-signed certificates as it avoids verifying the
            source site.
        :param sslverify:
            Disables SSL validation of the repository server for this
            transaction.
            This should be set to `false` if one of the configured
            repositories is using an untrusted or self-signed certificate.
        :param allow_downgrade:
            Specify if the named package and version is allowed to downgrade a
            maybe already installed higher version of that package. Note that
            setting allow_downgrade=True can make this module behave in a
            non-idempotent way. The task could end up with a set of packages
            that does not match the complete list of specified packages to
            install (because dependencies between the downgraded package and
            others can cause changes to the packages which were in the earlier
            transaction).
        :param install_repoquery:
            This is effectively a no-op in DNF as it is not needed with DNF.
            This option is deprecated and will be removed in ansible-core 2.20.
        :param download_only:
            Only download the packages, do not install them.
        :param lock_timeout:
            Amount of time to wait for the dnf lockfile to be freed.
        :param install_weak_deps:
            Will also install all packages linked by a weak dependency
            relation.
        :param download_dir:
            Specifies an alternate directory to store packages.
            Has an effect only if `download_only` is specified.
        :param allowerasing:
            If `true` it allows erasing of installed packages to resolve
            dependencies.
        :param nobest:
            This is the opposite of the `best` option kept for backwards
            compatibility.
            Since ansible-core 2.17 the default value is set by the operating
            system distribution.
        :param best:
            When set to `true`, either use a package with the highest version
            available or fail.
            When set to `false`, if the latest version cannot be installed go
            with the lower version.
            Default is set by the operating system distribution.
            Requires ansible-core >= 2.17
        :param cacheonly:
            Tells dnf to run entirely from system cache; does not download or

            setting allow_downgrade=True can make this module behave in a
            non-idempotent way. The task could end up with a set of packages
            that does not match the complete list of specified packages to

            others can cause changes to the packages which were in the earlier

        :param path:
            Path to the file being managed.
        :param state:
            If `absent`, directories will be recursively deleted, and files or
            symlinks will be unlinked. In the case of a directory, if `diff`
            is declared, you will see the files and folders deleted listed
            under `path_contents`. Note that `absent` will not cause
            :meth:`ansible.builtin.file` to fail if the `path` does not exist
            as the state did not change.
            If `directory`, all intermediate subdirectories will be created if
            they do not exist. Since Ansible 1.7 they will be created with the
            supplied permissions.
            If `file`, with no other options, returns the current state of
            `path`.
            If `file`, even with other options (such as `mode`), the file will
            be modified if it exists but will NOT be created if it does not
            exist. Set to `touch` or use the :meth:`ansible.builtin.copy` or
            :meth:`ansible.builtin.template` module if you want to create the
            file if it does not exist.
            If `hard`, the hard link will be created or changed.
            If `link`, the symbolic link will be created or changed.
            If `touch` (new in 1.4), an empty file will be created if the file
            does not exist, while an existing file or directory will receive
            updated file access and modification times (similar to the way
            `touch` works from the command line).
            Default is the current state of the file if it exists, `directory`
            if `recurse=yes`, or `file` otherwise.
        :param src:
            Path of the file to link to.
            This applies only to `state=link` and `state=hard`.
            For `state=link`, this will also accept a non-existing path.
            Relative paths are relative to the file being created (`path`)
            which is how the Unix command `ln -s SRC DEST` treats relative
            paths.
        :param recurse:
            Recursively set the specified file attributes on directory
            contents.
            This applies only when `state` is set to `directory`.
        :param force:
            Force the creation of the symlinks in two cases: the source file
            does not exist (but will appear later); the destination exists and
            is a file (so, we need to unlink the `path` file and create a
            symlink to the `src` file in place of it).
        :param follow:
            This flag indicates that filesystem links, if they exist, should
            be followed.
            `follow=yes` and `state=link` can modify `src` when combined with
            parameters such as `mode`.
            Previous to Ansible 2.5, this was `false` by default.
            While creating a symlink with a non-existent destination, set
            `follow` to `false` to avoid a warning message related to
            permission issues. The warning message is added to notify the user
            that we can not set permissions to the non-existent destination.
        :param modification_time:
            This parameter indicates the time the file's modification time
            should be set to.
            Should be `preserve` when no modification is required,
            `YYYYMMDDHHMM.SS` when using default time format, or `now`.
            Default is None meaning that `preserve` is the default for
            `state=[file,directory,link,hard]` and `now` is default for
            `state=touch`.
        :param modification_time_format:
            When used with `modification_time`, indicates the time format that
            must be used.
            Based on default Python format (see time.strftime doc).
        :param access_time:
            This parameter indicates the time the file's access time should be
            set to.
            Should be `preserve` when no modification is required,
            `YYYYMMDDHHMM.SS` when using default time format, or `now`.
            Default is `None` meaning that `preserve` is the default for
            `state=[file,directory,link,hard]` and `now` is default for
            `state=touch`.
        :param access_time_format:
            When used with `access_time`, indicates the time format that must
            be used.
            Based on default Python format (see time.strftime doc).
        :param mode:
            The permissions the resulting filesystem object should have.
            For those used to */usr/bin/chmod* remember that modes are
            actually octal numbers. You must give Ansible enough information
            to parse them correctly. For consistent results, quote octal
            numbers (for example, `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a
            string and can do its own conversion from string into number.
            Adding a leading zero (for example, `0755`) works sometimes, but
            can fail in loops and some other circumstances.
            Giving Ansible a number without following either of these rules
            will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected
            results.
            As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode
            (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`).
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does not** exist, the default `umask` on the system will be used
            when setting the mode for the newly created filesystem object.
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does** exist, the mode of the existing filesystem object will be
            used.
            Specifying `mode` is the best way to ensure filesystem objects are
            created with the correct permissions. See CVE-2020-1736 for
            further details.
        :param owner:
            Name of the user that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current user unless you are
            root, in which case it can preserve the previous ownership.
            Specifying a numeric username will be assumed to be a user ID and
            not a username. Avoid numeric usernames to avoid this confusion.
        :param group:
            Name of the group that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current group of the current
            user unless you are root, in which case it can preserve the
            previous ownership.
        :param seuser:
            The user part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            By default it uses the `system` policy, where applicable.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `user` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param serole:
            The role part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `role` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param setype:
            The type part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param selevel:
            The level part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param unsafe_writes:
            Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption
            or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem object.
            By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data
            corruption or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem
            objects, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in
            ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted filesystem
            objects, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the
            container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
            This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of
            updating filesystem objects when atomic operations fail (however,
            it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).
            IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can
            lead to data corruption.
        :param attributes:
            The attributes the resulting filesystem object should have.
            To get supported flags look at the man page for *chattr* on the
            target system.
            This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the
            one displayed by *lsattr*.
            The `=` operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+` or `-`
            operators need to be included in the string.

            Multiple patterns can be specified using a list.
            The pattern is matched against the file base name, excluding the

            When using regexen, the pattern MUST match the ENTIRE file name,
            not just parts of it. So if you are looking to match all files
            ending in .default, you'd need to use `.*\\.default` as a regexp
            and not just `\\.default`.
            This parameter expects a list, which can be either comma separated
            or YAML. If any of the patterns contain a comma, make sure to put
            them in a list to avoid splitting the patterns in undesirable ways.

            One or more (shell or regex) patterns, which type is controlled by
            `use_regex` option.
            Items whose basenames match an `excludes` pattern are culled from
            `patterns` matches. Multiple patterns can be specified using a
            list.
        :param contains:
            A regular expression or pattern which should be matched against
            the file content.
            If `read_whole_file` is `false` it matches against the beginning
            of the line (uses `re.match(\\`)). If `read_whole_file` is `true`,
            it searches anywhere for that pattern (uses `re.search(\\`)).
            Works only when `file_type` is `file`.
        :param read_whole_file:
            When doing a `contains` search, determines whether the whole file
            should be read into memory or if the regex should be applied to
            the file line-by-line.
            Setting this to `true` can have performance and memory
            implications for large files.
            This uses `re.search(\\`) instead of `re.match(\\`).
        :param paths:
            List of paths of directories to search. All paths must be fully
            qualified.
        :param file_type:
            Type of file to select.
            The 'link' and 'any' choices were added in Ansible 2.3.
        :param recurse:
            If target is a directory, recursively descend into the directory
            looking for files.
        :param size:
            Select files whose size is equal to or greater than the specified
            size.
            Use a negative size to find files equal to or less than the
            specified size.
            Unqualified values are in bytes but b, k, m, g, and t can be
            appended to specify bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and
            terabytes, respectively.
            Size is not evaluated for directories.
        :param age_stamp:
            Choose the file property against which we compare age.
        :param hidden:
            Set this to `true` to include hidden files, otherwise they will be
            ignored.
        :param mode:
            Choose objects matching a specified permission. This value is
            restricted to modes that can be applied using the python
            `os.chmod` function.
            The mode can be provided as an octal such as `"0644"` or as
            symbolic such as `u=rw,g=r,o=r`.
            Requires ansible-core >= 2.16
        :param exact_mode:
            Restrict mode matching to exact matches only, and not as a minimum
            set of permissions to match.
            Requires ansible-core >= 2.16
        :param follow:
            Set this to `true` to follow symlinks in path for systems with
            python 2.6+.
        :param get_checksum:
            Set this to `true` to retrieve a file's SHA1 checksum.
        :param use_regex:
            If `false`, the patterns are file globs (shell).
            If `true`, they are python regexes.
        :param depth:
            Set the maximum number of levels to descend into.
            Setting recurse to `false` will override this value, which is
            effectively depth 1.
            Default is unlimited depth.
        :param encoding:
            When doing a `contains` search, determine the encoding of the
            files to be searched.
            Requires ansible-core >= 2.17

            Whether to attempt to decompress gzip content-encoded responses.

        :param url:
            HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP URL in the form
            (http|https|ftp)://[user[:pass]]@host.domain[:port]/path.
        :param dest:
            Absolute path of where to download the file to.
            If `dest` is a directory, either the server provided filename or,
            if none provided, the base name of the URL on the remote server
            will be used. If a directory, `force` has no effect.
            If `dest` is a directory, the file will always be downloaded
            (regardless of the `force` and `checksum` option), but replaced
            only if the contents changed.
        :param tmp_dest:
            Absolute path of where temporary file is downloaded to.
            When run on Ansible 2.5 or greater, path defaults to ansible's
            remote_tmp setting.
            When run on Ansible prior to 2.5, it defaults to `TMPDIR`, `TEMP`
            or `TMP` env variables or a platform specific value.
            `tempfile.tempdir <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.tempdir>`__.
        :param force:
            If `true` and `dest` is not a directory, will download the file
            every time and replace the file if the contents change. If
            `false`, the file will only be downloaded if the destination does
            not exist. Generally should be `true` only for small local files.
            Prior to 0.6, this module behaved as if `true` was the default.
        :param backup:
            Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you
            can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it
            incorrectly.
        :param checksum:
            If a checksum is passed to this parameter, the digest of the
            destination file will be calculated after it is downloaded to
            ensure its integrity and verify that the transfer completed
            successfully. Format: <algorithm>:<checksum|url>, e.g.
            checksum="sha256:D98291AC[...]B6DC7B97",
            checksum="sha256:http://example.com/path/sha256sum.txt".
            If you worry about portability, only the sha1 algorithm is
            available on all platforms and python versions.
            The Python ``hashlib`` module is responsible for providing the
            available algorithms. The choices vary based on Python version and
            OpenSSL version.
            On systems running in FIPS compliant mode, the ``md5`` algorithm
            may be unavailable.
            Additionally, if a checksum is passed to this parameter, and the
            file exist under the `dest` location, the `destination_checksum`
            would be calculated, and if checksum equals
            `destination_checksum`, the file download would be skipped (unless
            `force` is `true`). If the checksum does not equal
            `destination_checksum`, the destination file is deleted.
        :param use_proxy:
            if `false`, it will not use a proxy, even if one is defined in an
            environment variable on the target hosts.
        :param validate_certs:
            If `false`, SSL certificates will not be validated.
            This should only be used on personally controlled sites using
            self-signed certificates.
        :param timeout:
            Timeout in seconds for URL request.
        :param headers:
            Add custom HTTP headers to a request in hash/dict format.
            The hash/dict format was added in Ansible 2.6.
            Previous versions used a `"key:value,key:value"` string format.
            The `"key:value,key:value"` string format is deprecated and has
            been removed in version 2.10.
        :param url_username:
            The username for use in HTTP basic authentication.
            This parameter can be used without `url_password` for sites that
            allow empty passwords.
            Since version 2.8 you can also use the `username` alias for this
            option.
        :param url_password:
            The password for use in HTTP basic authentication.
            If the `url_username` parameter is not specified, the
            `url_password` parameter will not be used.
            Since version 2.8 you can also use the `password` alias for this
            option.
        :param force_basic_auth:
            Force the sending of the Basic authentication header upon initial
            request.
            httplib2, the library used by the uri module only sends
            authentication information when a webservice responds to an
            initial request with a 401 status. Since some basic auth services
            do not properly send a 401, logins will fail.
        :param client_cert:
            PEM formatted certificate chain file to be used for SSL client
            authentication.
            This file can also include the key as well, and if the key is
            included, `client_key` is not required.
        :param client_key:
            PEM formatted file that contains your private key to be used for
            SSL client authentication.
            If `client_cert` contains both the certificate and key, this
            option is not required.
        :param http_agent:
            Header to identify as, generally appears in web server logs.
        :param unredirected_headers:
            A list of header names that will not be sent on subsequent
            redirected requests. This list is case insensitive. By default all
            headers will be redirected. In some cases it may be beneficial to
            list headers such as `Authorization` here to avoid potential
            credential exposure.
        :param use_gssapi:
            Use GSSAPI to perform the authentication, typically this is for
            Kerberos or Kerberos through Negotiate authentication.
            Requires the Python library `gssapi
            <https://github.com/pythongssapi/python-gssapi>`__ to be installed.
            Credentials for GSSAPI can be specified with
            `url_username`/`url_password` or with the GSSAPI env var
            `KRB5CCNAME` that specified a custom Kerberos credential cache.
            NTLM authentication is *not* supported even if the GSSAPI mech for
            NTLM has been installed.
        :param use_netrc:
            Determining whether to use credentials from ``~/.netrc`` file.
            By default .netrc is used with Basic authentication headers.
            When set to False, .netrc credentials are ignored.
            Requires ansible-core >= 2.14
        :param mode:
            The permissions the resulting filesystem object should have.
            For those used to */usr/bin/chmod* remember that modes are
            actually octal numbers. You must give Ansible enough information
            to parse them correctly. For consistent results, quote octal
            numbers (for example, `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a
            string and can do its own conversion from string into number.
            Adding a leading zero (for example, `0755`) works sometimes, but
            can fail in loops and some other circumstances.
            Giving Ansible a number without following either of these rules
            will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected
            results.
            As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode
            (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`).
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does not** exist, the default `umask` on the system will be used
            when setting the mode for the newly created filesystem object.
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does** exist, the mode of the existing filesystem object will be
            used.
            Specifying `mode` is the best way to ensure filesystem objects are
            created with the correct permissions. See CVE-2020-1736 for
            further details.
        :param owner:
            Name of the user that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current user unless you are
            root, in which case it can preserve the previous ownership.
            Specifying a numeric username will be assumed to be a user ID and
            not a username. Avoid numeric usernames to avoid this confusion.
        :param group:
            Name of the group that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current group of the current
            user unless you are root, in which case it can preserve the
            previous ownership.
        :param seuser:
            The user part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            By default it uses the `system` policy, where applicable.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `user` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param serole:
            The role part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `role` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param setype:
            The type part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param selevel:
            The level part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param unsafe_writes:
            Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption
            or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem object.
            By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data
            corruption or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem
            objects, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in
            ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted filesystem
            objects, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the
            container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
            This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of
            updating filesystem objects when atomic operations fail (however,
            it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).
            IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can
            lead to data corruption.
        :param attributes:
            The attributes the resulting filesystem object should have.
            To get supported flags look at the man page for *chattr* on the
            target system.
            This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the
            one displayed by *lsattr*.
            The `=` operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+` or `-`
            operators need to be included in the string.

            :ref:`ansible.builtin <ansible_collections.ansible.builtin.git_module>`

        :param repo:
            git, SSH, or HTT`S` protocol address of the git repository.
        :param dest:
            The path of where the repository should be checked out. This is
            equivalent to `git clone [repo_url] [directory]`. The repository
            named in `repo` is not appended to this path and the destination
            directory must be empty. This parameter is required, unless
            `clone` is set to `false`.
        :param version:
            What version of the repository to check out. This can be the
            literal string `HEAD`, a branch name, a tag name. It can also be a
            *SHA-1* hash, in which case `refspec` needs to be specified if the
            given revision is not already available.
        :param accept_hostkey:
            Will ensure or not that "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" is present
            as an ssh option.
            Be aware that this disables a protection against MITM attacks.
            Those using OpenSSH >= 7.5 might want to set `ssh_opts` to
            `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` instead, it does not remove the
            MITM issue but it does restrict it to the first attempt.
        :param accept_newhostkey:
            As of OpenSSH 7.5, "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new" can be
            used which is safer and will only accepts host keys which are not
            present or are the same. if `true`, ensure that "-o
            StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new" is present as an ssh option.
        :param ssh_opts:
            Options git will pass to ssh when used as protocol, it works via
            `git`'s `GIT_SSH`/`GIT_SSH_COMMAND` environment variables.
            For older versions it appends `GIT_SSH_OPTS` (specific to this
            module) to the variables above or via a wrapper script.
            Other options can add to this list, like `key_file` and
            `accept_hostkey`.
            An example value could be "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" (although
            this particular option is better set by `accept_hostkey`).
            The module ensures that 'BatchMode=yes' is always present to avoid
            prompts.
        :param key_file:
            Specify an optional private key file path, on the target host, to
            use for the checkout.
            This ensures 'IdentitiesOnly=yes' is present in `ssh_opts`.
        :param reference:
            Reference repository (see "git clone --reference ...").
        :param remote:
            Name of the remote.
        :param refspec:
            Add an additional refspec to be fetched. If version is set to a
            *SHA-1* not reachable from any branch or tag, this option may be
            necessary to specify the ref containing the *SHA-1*. Uses the same
            syntax as the `git fetch` command. An example value could be
            "refs/meta/config".
        :param force:
            If `true`, any modified files in the working repository will be
            discarded. Prior to 0.7, this was always `true` and could not be
            disabled. Prior to 1.9, the default was `true`.
        :param depth:
            Create a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified
            number or revisions. The minimum possible value is `1`, otherwise
            ignored. Needs *git>=1.9.1* to work correctly.
        :param clone:
            If `false`, do not clone the repository even if it does not exist
            locally.
        :param update:
            If `false`, do not retrieve new revisions from the origin
            repository.
            Operations like archive will work on the existing (old) repository
            and might not respond to changes to the options version or remote.
        :param executable:
            Path to git executable to use. If not supplied, the normal
            mechanism for resolving binary paths will be used.
        :param bare:
            If `true`, repository will be created as a bare repo, otherwise it
            will be a standard repo with a workspace.
        :param umask:
            The umask to set before doing any checkouts, or any other
            repository maintenance.
        :param recursive:
            If `false`, repository will be cloned without the `--recursive`
            option, skipping sub-modules.
        :param single_branch:
            Clone only the history leading to the tip of the specified
            revision.
        :param track_submodules:
            If `true`, submodules will track the latest commit on their master
            branch (or other branch specified in .gitmodules). If `false`,
            submodules will be kept at the revision specified by the main
            project. This is equivalent to specifying the `--remote` flag to
            git submodule update.
        :param verify_commit:
            If `true`, when cloning or checking out a `version` verify the
            signature of a GPG signed commit. This requires git version>=2.1.0
            to be installed. The commit MUST be signed and the public key MUST
            be present in the GPG keyring.
        :param archive:
            Specify archive file path with extension. If specified, creates an
            archive file of the specified format containing the tree structure
            for the source tree. Allowed archive formats ["zip", "tar.gz",
            "tar", "tgz"].
            This will clone and perform git archive from local directory as
            not all git servers support git archive.
        :param archive_prefix:
            Specify a prefix to add to each file path in archive. Requires
            `archive` to be specified.
        :param separate_git_dir:
            The path to place the cloned repository. If specified, Git
            repository can be separated from working tree.
        :param gpg_allowlist:
            A list of trusted GPG fingerprints to compare to the fingerprint
            of the GPG-signed commit.
            Only used when `verify_commit=yes`.
            Use of this feature requires Git 2.6+ due to its reliance on git's
            `--raw` flag to `verify-commit` and `verify-tag`.
            Alias `gpg_allowlist` is added in version 2.17.
            Alias `gpg_whitelist` is deprecated and will be removed in version
            2.21.

        :param ignore_unknown_extensions:
            Ignore unknown file extensions within the directory.
            This allows users to specify a directory containing vars files
            that are intermingled with non-vars files extension types (e.g. a
            directory with a README in it and vars files).
        :param hash_behaviour:
            If set to `merge`, merges existing hash variables instead of
            overwriting them.
            If omitted (`null`), the behavior falls back to the global
            `hash_behaviour` configuration.
            This option is self-contained and does not apply to individual
            files in `dir`. You can use a loop to apply `hash_behaviour` per
            file.

        .. seealso::
            :ref:`ansible.builtin <ansible_collections.ansible.builtin.iptables_module>`

        :param table:
            This option specifies the packet matching table on which the
            command should operate.
            If the kernel is configured with automatic module loading, an
            attempt will be made to load the appropriate module for that table
            if it is not already there.
        :param state:
            Whether the rule should be absent or present.
        :param action:
            Whether the rule should be appended at the bottom or inserted at
            the top.
            If the rule already exists the chain will not be modified.
        :param rule_num:
            Insert the rule as the given rule number.
            This works only with `action=insert`.
        :param ip_version:
            Which version of the IP protocol this rule should apply to.
        :param chain:
            Specify the iptables chain to modify.
            This could be a user-defined chain or one of the standard iptables
            chains, like `INPUT`, `FORWARD`, `OUTPUT`, `PREROUTING`,
            `POSTROUTING`, `SECMARK` or `CONNSECMARK`.
        :param protocol:
            The protocol of the rule or of the packet to check.
            The specified protocol can be one of `tcp`, `udp`, `udplite`,
            `icmp`, `ipv6-icmp` or `icmpv6`, `esp`, `ah`, `sctp` or the
            special keyword `all`, or it can be a numeric value, representing
            one of these protocols or a different one.
            A protocol name from `/etc/protocols` is also allowed.
            A `!` argument before the protocol inverts the test.
            The number zero is equivalent to all.
            `all` will match with all protocols and is taken as default when
            this option is omitted.
        :param source:
            Source specification.
            Address can be either a network name, a hostname, a network IP
            address (with /mask), or a plain IP address.
            Hostnames will be resolved once only, before the rule is submitted
            to the kernel. Please note that specifying any name to be resolved
            with a remote query such as DNS is a really bad idea.
            The mask can be either a network mask or a plain number,
            specifying the number of 1's at the left side of the network mask.
            Thus, a mask of 24 is equivalent to 255.255.255.0. A `!` argument
            before the address specification inverts the sense of the address.
        :param destination:
            Destination specification.
            Address can be either a network name, a hostname, a network IP
            address (with /mask), or a plain IP address.
            Hostnames will be resolved once only, before the rule is submitted
            to the kernel. Please note that specifying any name to be resolved
            with a remote query such as DNS is a really bad idea.
            The mask can be either a network mask or a plain number,
            specifying the number of 1's at the left side of the network mask.
            Thus, a mask of 24 is equivalent to 255.255.255.0. A `!` argument
            before the address specification inverts the sense of the address.
        :param tcp_flags:
            TCP flags specification.
            `tcp_flags` expects a dict with the two keys `flags` and
            `flags_set`.
        :param match:
            Specifies a match to use, that is, an extension module that tests
            for a specific property.
            The set of matches makes up the condition under which a target is
            invoked.
            Matches are evaluated first to last if specified as an array and
            work in short-circuit fashion, i.e. if one extension yields false,
            the evaluation will stop.
        :param jump:
            This specifies the target of the rule; i.e., what to do if the
            packet matches it.
            The target can be a user-defined chain (other than the one this
            rule is in), one of the special builtin targets that decide the
            fate of the packet immediately, or an extension (see EXTENSIONS
            below).
            If this option is omitted in a rule (and the goto parameter is not
            used), then matching the rule will have no effect on the packet's
            fate, but the counters on the rule will be incremented.
        :param gateway:
            This specifies the IP address of the host to send the cloned
            packets.
            This option is only valid when `jump` is set to `TEE`.
        :param log_prefix:
            Specifies a log text for the rule. Only makes sense with a LOG
            jump.
        :param log_level:
            Logging level according to the syslogd-defined priorities.
            The value can be strings or numbers from 1-8.
            This parameter is only applicable if `jump` is set to `LOG`.
        :param goto:
            This specifies that the processing should continue in a
            user-specified chain.
            Unlike the jump argument return will not continue processing in
            this chain but instead in the chain that called us via jump.
        :param in_interface:
            Name of an interface via which a packet was received (only for
            packets entering the `INPUT`, `FORWARD` and `PREROUTING` chains).
            When the `!` argument is used before the interface name, the sense
            is inverted.
            If the interface name ends in a `+`, then any interface which
            begins with this name will match.
            If this option is omitted, any interface name will match.
        :param out_interface:
            Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be sent (for
            packets entering the `FORWARD`, `OUTPUT` and `POSTROUTING` chains).
            When the `!` argument is used before the interface name, the sense
            is inverted.
            If the interface name ends in a `+`, then any interface which
            begins with this name will match.
            If this option is omitted, any interface name will match.
        :param fragment:
            This means that the rule only refers to second and further
            fragments of fragmented packets.
            Since there is no way to tell the source or destination ports of
            such a packet (or ICMP type), such a packet will not match any
            rules which specify them.
            When the "!" argument precedes the fragment argument, the rule
            will only match head fragments, or unfragmented packets.
        :param set_counters:
            This enables the administrator to initialize the packet and byte
            counters of a rule (during `INSERT`, `APPEND`, `REPLACE`
            operations).
        :param source_port:
            Source port or port range specification.
            This can either be a service name or a port number.
            An inclusive range can also be specified, using the format
            `first:last`.
            If the first port is omitted, `0` is assumed; if the last is
            omitted, `65535` is assumed.
            If the first port is greater than the second one they will be
            swapped.
        :param destination_port:
            Destination port or port range specification. This can either be a
            service name or a port number. An inclusive range can also be
            specified, using the format first:last. If the first port is
            omitted, '0' is assumed; if the last is omitted, '65535' is
            assumed. If the first port is greater than the second one they
            will be swapped. This is only valid if the rule also specifies one
            of the following protocols: tcp, udp, dccp or sctp.
        :param destination_ports:
            This specifies multiple destination port numbers or port ranges to
            match in the multiport module.
            It can only be used in conjunction with the protocols tcp, udp,
            udplite, dccp and sctp.
        :param to_ports:
            This specifies a destination port or range of ports to use,
            without this, the destination port is never altered.
            This is only valid if the rule also specifies one of the protocol
            `tcp`, `udp`, `dccp` or `sctp`.
        :param to_destination:
            This specifies a destination address to use with `DNAT`.
            Without this, the destination address is never altered.
        :param to_source:
            This specifies a source address to use with `SNAT`.
            Without this, the source address is never altered.
        :param syn:
            This allows matching packets that have the SYN bit set and the ACK
            and RST bits unset.
            When negated, this matches all packets with the RST or the ACK
            bits set.
        :param set_dscp_mark:
            This allows specifying a DSCP mark to be added to packets. It
            takes either an integer or hex value.
            If the parameter is set, `jump` is set to `DSCP`.
            Mutually exclusive with `set_dscp_mark_class`.
        :param set_dscp_mark_class:
            This allows specifying a predefined DiffServ class which will be
            translated to the corresponding DSCP mark.
            If the parameter is set, `jump` is set to `DSCP`.
            Mutually exclusive with `set_dscp_mark`.
        :param comment:
            This specifies a comment that will be added to the rule.
        :param ctstate:
            A list of the connection states to match in the conntrack module.
            Possible values are `INVALID`, `NEW`, `ESTABLISHED`, `RELATED`,
            `UNTRACKED`, `SNAT`, `DNAT`.
        :param src_range:
            Specifies the source IP range to match the iprange module.
        :param dst_range:
            Specifies the destination IP range to match in the iprange module.
        :param match_set:
            Specifies a set name that can be defined by ipset.
            Must be used together with the `match_set_flags` parameter.
            When the `!` argument is prepended then it inverts the rule.
            Uses the iptables set extension.
        :param match_set_flags:
            Specifies the necessary flags for the match_set parameter.
            Must be used together with the `match_set` parameter.
            Uses the iptables set extension.
            Choices `dst,dst` and `src,src` added in version 2.17.
        :param limit:
            Specifies the maximum average number of matches to allow per
            second.
            The number can specify units explicitly, using `/second`,
            `/minute`, `/hour` or `/day`, or parts of them (so `5/second` is
            the same as `5/s`).
        :param limit_burst:
            Specifies the maximum burst before the above limit kicks in.
        :param uid_owner:
            Specifies the UID or username to use in the match by owner rule.
            From Ansible 2.6 when the `!` argument is prepended then the it
            inverts the rule to apply instead to all users except that one
            specified.
        :param gid_owner:
            Specifies the GID or group to use in the match by owner rule.
        :param reject_with:
            Specifies the error packet type to return while rejecting. It
            implies "jump: REJECT".
        :param icmp_type:
            This allows specification of the ICMP type, which can be a numeric
            ICMP type, type/code pair, or one of the ICMP type names shown by
            the command 'iptables -p icmp -h'.
        :param flush:
            Flushes the specified table and chain of all rules.
            If no chain is specified then the entire table is purged.
            Ignores all other parameters.
        :param policy:
            Set the policy for the chain to the given target.
            Only built-in chains can have policies.
            This parameter requires the `chain` parameter.
            If you specify this parameter, all other parameters will be
            ignored.
            This parameter is used to set the default policy for the given
            `chain`. Do not confuse this with `jump` parameter.
        :param wait:
            Wait N seconds for the xtables lock to prevent multiple instances
            of the program from running concurrently.
        :param chain_management:
            If `true` and `state` is `present`, the chain will be created if
            needed.
            If `true` and `state` is `absent`, the chain will be deleted if
            the only other parameter passed are `chain` and optionally `table`.
        :param numeric:
            This parameter controls the running of the list -action of
            iptables, which is used internally by the module.
            Does not affect the actual functionality. Use this if iptables
            hang when creating a chain or altering policy.
            If `true`, then iptables skips the DNS-lookup of the IP addresses
            in a chain when it uses the list -action.
            Listing is used internally for example when setting a policy or
            creating a chain.

        :param path:
            The file to modify.
            Before Ansible 2.3 this option was only usable as `dest`,
            `destfile` and `name`.
        :param regexp:
            The regular expression to look for in every line of the file.
            For `state=present`, the pattern to replace if found. Only the
            last line found will be replaced.
            For `state=absent`, the pattern of the line(s) to remove.
            If the regular expression is not matched, the line will be added
            to the file in keeping with `insertbefore` or `insertafter`
            settings.
            When modifying a line the regexp should typically match both the
            initial state of the line as well as its state after replacement
            by `line` to ensure idempotence.
            Uses Python regular expressions. See
            `reference <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>`__.
        :param search_string:
            The literal string to look for in every line of the file. This
            does not have to match the entire line.
            For `state=present`, the line to replace if the string is found in
            the file. Only the last line found will be replaced.
            For `state=absent`, the line(s) to remove if the string is in the
            line.
            If the literal expression is not matched, the line will be added
            to the file in keeping with `insertbefore` or `insertafter`
            settings.
            Mutually exclusive with `backrefs` and `regexp`.
        :param state:
            Whether the line should be there or not.
        :param line:
            The line to insert/replace into the file.
            Required for `state=present`.
            If `backrefs` is set, may contain backreferences that will get
            expanded with the `regexp` capture groups if the regexp matches.
        :param backrefs:
            Used with `state=present`.
            If set, `line` can contain backreferences (both positional and
            named) that will get populated if the `regexp` matches.
            This parameter changes the operation of the module slightly;
            `insertbefore` and `insertafter` will be ignored, and if the
            `regexp` does not match anywhere in the file, the file will be
            left unchanged.
            If the `regexp` does match, the last matching line will be
            replaced by the expanded line parameter.
            Mutually exclusive with `search_string`.
        :param insertafter:
            Used with `state=present`.
            If specified, the line will be inserted after the last match of
            specified regular expression.
            If the first match is required, use(firstmatch=yes).
            A special value is available; `EOF` for inserting the line at the
            end of the file.
            If specified regular expression has no matches, EOF will be used
            instead.
            If `insertbefore` is set, default value `EOF` will be ignored.
            If regular expressions are passed to both `regexp` and
            `insertafter`, `insertafter` is only honored if no match for
            `regexp` is found.
            May not be used with `backrefs` or `insertbefore`.
        :param insertbefore:
            Used with `state=present`.
            If specified, the line will be inserted before the last match of
            specified regular expression.
            If the first match is required, use `firstmatch=yes`.
            A value is available; `BOF` for inserting the line at the
            beginning of the file.
            If specified regular expression has no matches, the line will be
            inserted at the end of the file.
            If regular expressions are passed to both `regexp` and
            `insertbefore`, `insertbefore` is only honored if no match for
            `regexp` is found.
            May not be used with `backrefs` or `insertafter`.
        :param create:
            Used with `state=present`.
            If specified, the file will be created if it does not already
            exist.
            By default it will fail if the file is missing.
        :param backup:
            Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you
            can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it
            incorrectly.
        :param firstmatch:
            Used with `insertafter` or `insertbefore`.
            If set, `insertafter` and `insertbefore` will work with the first
            line that matches the given regular expression.
        :param mode:
            The permissions the resulting filesystem object should have.
            For those used to */usr/bin/chmod* remember that modes are
            actually octal numbers. You must give Ansible enough information
            to parse them correctly. For consistent results, quote octal
            numbers (for example, `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a
            string and can do its own conversion from string into number.
            Adding a leading zero (for example, `0755`) works sometimes, but
            can fail in loops and some other circumstances.
            Giving Ansible a number without following either of these rules
            will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected
            results.
            As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode
            (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`).
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does not** exist, the default `umask` on the system will be used
            when setting the mode for the newly created filesystem object.
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does** exist, the mode of the existing filesystem object will be
            used.
            Specifying `mode` is the best way to ensure filesystem objects are
            created with the correct permissions. See CVE-2020-1736 for
            further details.
        :param owner:
            Name of the user that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current user unless you are
            root, in which case it can preserve the previous ownership.
            Specifying a numeric username will be assumed to be a user ID and
            not a username. Avoid numeric usernames to avoid this confusion.
        :param group:
            Name of the group that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current group of the current
            user unless you are root, in which case it can preserve the
            previous ownership.
        :param seuser:
            The user part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            By default it uses the `system` policy, where applicable.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `user` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param serole:
            The role part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `role` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param setype:
            The type part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param selevel:
            The level part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param unsafe_writes:
            Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption
            or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem object.
            By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data
            corruption or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem
            objects, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in
            ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted filesystem
            objects, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the
            container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
            This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of
            updating filesystem objects when atomic operations fail (however,
            it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).
            IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can
            lead to data corruption.
        :param attributes:
            The attributes the resulting filesystem object should have.
            To get supported flags look at the man page for *chattr* on the
            target system.
            This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the
            one displayed by *lsattr*.
            The `=` operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+` or `-`
            operators need to be included in the string.
        :param validate:
            The validation command to run before copying the updated file into
            the final destination.
            A temporary file path is used to validate, passed in through '%s'
            which must be present as in the examples below.
            Also, the command is passed securely so shell features such as
            expansion and pipes will not work.
            For an example on how to handle more complex validation than what
            this option provides, see `handling complex validation`.

            Python interpreter and for the version of Python specified by this
            option.
        :param umask:
            The system umask to apply before installing the pip package. This
            is useful, for example, when installing on systems that have a

            The file to modify.
            Before Ansible 2.3 this option was only usable as `dest`,
            `destfile` and `name`.
        :param regexp:
            The regular expression to look for in the contents of the file.
            Uses Python regular expressions; see
            `reference <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>`__.
            Uses MULTILINE mode, which means `^` and `$` match the beginning
            and end of the file, as well as the beginning and end respectively
            of *each line* of the file.
            Does not use DOTALL, which means the `.` special character matches
            any character *except newlines*. A common mistake is to assume
            that a negated character set like `[^#]` will also not match
            newlines.
            In order to exclude newlines, they must be added to the set like
            `[^#\\n]`.
            Note that, as of Ansible 2.0, short form tasks should have any
            escape sequences backslash-escaped in order to prevent them being
            parsed as string literal escapes. See the examples.
        :param replace:
            The string to replace regexp matches.
            May contain backreferences that will get expanded with the regexp
            capture groups if the regexp matches.
            If not set, matches are removed entirely.
            Backreferences can be used ambiguously like `\\1`, or explicitly
            like `\\g<1>`.
        :param after:
            If specified, only content after this match will be
            replaced/removed.
            Can be used in combination with `before`.
            Uses Python regular expressions; see
            `reference <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>`__.
            Uses DOTALL, which means the `.` special character *can match
            newlines*.
            Does not use MULTILINE, so `^` and `$` will only match the
            beginning and end of the file.
        :param before:
            If specified, only content before this match will be
            replaced/removed.
            Can be used in combination with `after`.
            Uses Python regular expressions; see

            Uses DOTALL, which means the `.` special character *can match

            Does not use MULTILINE, so `^` and `$` will only match the
            beginning and end of the file.
        :param backup:
            Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you
            can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it
            incorrectly.
        :param others:
            All arguments accepted by the :meth:`ansible.builtin.file` module
            also work here.
        :param encoding:
            The character encoding for reading and writing the file.
        :param mode:
            The permissions the resulting filesystem object should have.
            For those used to */usr/bin/chmod* remember that modes are
            actually octal numbers. You must give Ansible enough information
            to parse them correctly. For consistent results, quote octal
            numbers (for example, `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a
            string and can do its own conversion from string into number.
            Adding a leading zero (for example, `0755`) works sometimes, but
            can fail in loops and some other circumstances.
            Giving Ansible a number without following either of these rules
            will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected
            results.
            As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode
            (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`).
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does not** exist, the default `umask` on the system will be used
            when setting the mode for the newly created filesystem object.
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does** exist, the mode of the existing filesystem object will be
            used.
            Specifying `mode` is the best way to ensure filesystem objects are
            created with the correct permissions. See CVE-2020-1736 for
            further details.
        :param owner:
            Name of the user that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current user unless you are
            root, in which case it can preserve the previous ownership.
            Specifying a numeric username will be assumed to be a user ID and
            not a username. Avoid numeric usernames to avoid this confusion.
        :param group:
            Name of the group that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current group of the current
            user unless you are root, in which case it can preserve the
            previous ownership.
        :param seuser:
            The user part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            By default it uses the `system` policy, where applicable.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `user` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param serole:
            The role part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `role` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param setype:
            The type part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param selevel:
            The level part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param unsafe_writes:
            Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption
            or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem object.
            By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data
            corruption or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem
            objects, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in
            ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted filesystem
            objects, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the
            container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
            This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of
            updating filesystem objects when atomic operations fail (however,
            it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).
            IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can
            lead to data corruption.
        :param attributes:
            The attributes the resulting filesystem object should have.
            To get supported flags look at the man page for *chattr* on the
            target system.
            This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the
            one displayed by *lsattr*.
            The `=` operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+` or `-`
            operators need to be included in the string.
        :param validate:
            The validation command to run before copying the updated file into
            the final destination.
            A temporary file path is used to validate, passed in through '%s'
            which must be present as in the examples below.
            Also, the command is passed securely so shell features such as
            expansion and pipes will not work.
            For an example on how to handle more complex validation than what
            this option provides, see `handling complex validation`.

            pairs or `key: value` (YAML notation) as variables to set in the
            playbook scope. The 'key' is the resulting variable name and the
            value is, of course, the value of said variable.
            You can create multiple variables at once, by supplying multiple
            pairs, but do NOT mix notations.
        :param cacheable:
            This boolean converts the variable into an actual 'fact' which
            will also be added to the fact cache. It does not enable fact
            caching across runs, it just means it will work with it if already
            enabled.
            Normally this module creates 'host level variables' and has much
            higher precedence, this option changes the nature and precedence
            (by 7 steps) of the variable created.
            `variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable>`__.
            This actually creates 2 copies of the variable, a normal
            'set_fact' host variable with high precedence and a lower
            'ansible_fact' one that is available for persistence via the facts
            cache plugin. This creates a possibly confusing interaction with
            `meta: clear_facts` as it will remove the 'ansible_fact' but not
            the host variable.

            default has became an empty list. A simple string is still

            instead. File/results format can be JSON or INI-format. The
            default `fact_path` can be specified in `ansible.cfg` for when
            setup is automatically called as part of `gather_facts`. NOTE -
            For windows clients, the results will be added to a variable named
            after the local file (without extension suffix), rather than
            `ansible_local`.
            Since Ansible 2.1, Windows hosts can use `fact_path`. Make sure
            that this path exists on the target host. Files in this path MUST
            be PowerShell scripts `.ps1` which outputs an object. This object
            will be formatted by Ansible as json so the script should be
            outputting a raw hashtable, array, or other primitive object.

            For systemd to work with 'user', the executing user must have its
            own instance of dbus started and accessible (systemd requirement).
            The user dbus process is normally started during normal login, but
            not during the run of Ansible tasks. Otherwise you will probably
            get a 'Failed to connect to bus: no such file or directory' error.
            The user must have access, normally given via setting the
            `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` variable, see the example below.

            Do not synchronously wait for the requested operation to finish.

            Previous to Ansible 2.4, this was hardcoded as `true`.
        :param backup:
            Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you
            can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it
            incorrectly.
        :param mode:
            The permissions the resulting filesystem object should have.
            For those used to */usr/bin/chmod* remember that modes are
            actually octal numbers. You must give Ansible enough information
            to parse them correctly. For consistent results, quote octal
            numbers (for example, `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a
            string and can do its own conversion from string into number.
            Adding a leading zero (for example, `0755`) works sometimes, but
            can fail in loops and some other circumstances.
            Giving Ansible a number without following either of these rules
            will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected
            results.
            As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode
            (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`).
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does not** exist, the default `umask` on the system will be used
            when setting the mode for the newly created filesystem object.
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does** exist, the mode of the existing filesystem object will be
            used.
            Specifying `mode` is the best way to ensure filesystem objects are
            created with the correct permissions. See CVE-2020-1736 for
            further details.
        :param owner:
            Name of the user that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current user unless you are
            root, in which case it can preserve the previous ownership.
            Specifying a numeric username will be assumed to be a user ID and
            not a username. Avoid numeric usernames to avoid this confusion.
        :param group:
            Name of the group that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current group of the current
            user unless you are root, in which case it can preserve the
            previous ownership.
        :param seuser:
            The user part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            By default it uses the `system` policy, where applicable.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `user` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param serole:
            The role part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `role` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param setype:
            The type part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param selevel:
            The level part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param unsafe_writes:
            Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption
            or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem object.
            By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data
            corruption or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem
            objects, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in
            ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted filesystem
            objects, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the
            container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
            This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of
            updating filesystem objects when atomic operations fail (however,
            it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).
            IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can
            lead to data corruption.
        :param attributes:
            The attributes the resulting filesystem object should have.
            To get supported flags look at the man page for *chattr* on the
            target system.
            This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the
            one displayed by *lsattr*.
            The `=` operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+` or `-`
            operators need to be included in the string.
        :param src:
            Path of a Jinja2 formatted template on the Ansible controller.
            This can be a relative or an absolute path.
            The file must be encoded with `utf-8` but `output_encoding` can be
            used to control the encoding of the output template.
        :param dest:
            Location to render the template to on the remote machine.
        :param newline_sequence:
            Specify the newline sequence to use for templating files.
        :param block_start_string:
            The string marking the beginning of a block.
        :param block_end_string:
            The string marking the end of a block.
        :param variable_start_string:
            The string marking the beginning of a print statement.
        :param variable_end_string:
            The string marking the end of a print statement.
        :param comment_start_string:
            The string marking the beginning of a comment statement.
        :param comment_end_string:
            The string marking the end of a comment statement.
        :param trim_blocks:
            Determine when newlines should be removed from blocks.
            When set to `True` the first newline after a block is removed
            (block, not variable tag!).
        :param lstrip_blocks:
            Determine when leading spaces and tabs should be stripped.
            When set to `True` leading spaces and tabs are stripped from the
            start of a line to a block.
        :param force:
            Determine when the file is being transferred if the destination
            already exists.
            When set to `True`, replace the remote file when contents are
            different than the source.
            When set to `False`, the file will only be transferred if the
            destination does not exist.
        :param output_encoding:
            Overrides the encoding used to write the template file defined by
            `dest`.
            It defaults to `utf-8`, but any encoding supported by python can
            be used.
            The source template file must always be encoded using `utf-8`, for
            homogeneity.
        :param validate:
            The validation command to run before copying the updated file into
            the final destination.
            A temporary file path is used to validate, passed in through '%s'
            which must be present as in the examples below.
            Also, the command is passed securely so shell features such as
            expansion and pipes will not work.
            For an example on how to handle more complex validation than what
            this option provides, see `handling complex validation`.

        :param unsafe_writes:
            Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption
            or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem object.
            By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data
            corruption or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem
            objects, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in
            ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted filesystem
            objects, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the
            container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
            This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of
            updating filesystem objects when atomic operations fail (however,
            it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).
            IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can
            lead to data corruption.
        :param attributes:
            The attributes the resulting filesystem object should have.
            To get supported flags look at the man page for *chattr* on the

            This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the

            OpenSSL/LibreSSL versions.
            Requires ansible-core >= 2.14
        :param decompress:
            Whether to attempt to decompress gzip content-encoded responses.
            Requires ansible-core >= 2.14
        :param url:
            HTTP or HTTPS URL in the form
            (http|https)://host.domain[:port]/path.
        :param dest:
            A path of where to download the file to (if desired). If `dest` is
            a directory, the basename of the file on the remote server will be
            used.
        :param url_username:
            A username for the module to use for Digest, Basic or WSSE
            authentication.
        :param url_password:
            A password for the module to use for Digest, Basic or WSSE
            authentication.
        :param body:
            The body of the http request/response to the web service. If
            `body_format` is set to `json` it will take an already formatted
            JSON string or convert a data structure into JSON.
            If `body_format` is set to `form-urlencoded` it will convert a
            dictionary or list of tuples into an
            'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' string. (Added in v2.7).
            If `body_format` is set to `form-multipart` it will convert a
            dictionary into 'multipart/form-multipart' body. (Added in v2.10).
        :param body_format:
            The serialization format of the body. When set to `json`,
            `form-multipart`, or `form-urlencoded`, encodes the body argument,
            if needed, and automatically sets the Content-Type header
            accordingly.
            As of v2.3 it is possible to override the `Content-Type` header,
            when set to `json` or `form-urlencoded` via the `headers` option.
            The 'Content-Type' header cannot be overridden when using
            `form-multipart`.
            `form-urlencoded` was added in v2.7.
            `form-multipart` was added in v2.10.
        :param method:
            The HTTP method of the request or response.
            In more recent versions we do not restrict the method at the
            module level anymore but it still must be a valid method accepted
            by the service handling the request.
        :param return_content:
            Whether or not to return the body of the response as a "content"
            key in the dictionary result no matter it succeeded or failed.
            Independently of this option, if the reported Content-type is
            "application/json", then the JSON is always loaded into a key
            called `ignore:json` in the dictionary results.
        :param force_basic_auth:
            Force the sending of the Basic authentication header upon initial
            request.
            When this setting is `false`, this module will first try an
            unauthenticated request, and when the server replies with an
            `HTTP 401` error, it will submit the Basic authentication header.
            When this setting is `true`, this module will immediately send a
            Basic authentication header on the first request.
            Use this setting in any of the following scenarios:.
            You know the webservice endpoint always requires HTTP Basic
            authentication, and you want to speed up your requests by
            eliminating the first roundtrip.
            The web service does not properly send an HTTP 401 error to your
            client, so Ansible's HTTP library will not properly respond with
            HTTP credentials, and logins will fail.
            The webservice bans or rate-limits clients that cause any HTTP 401
            errors.
        :param follow_redirects:
            Whether or not the URI module should follow redirects.
        :param creates:
            A filename, when it already exists, this step will not be run.
        :param removes:
            A filename, when it does not exist, this step will not be run.
        :param status_code:
            A list of valid, numeric, HTTP status codes that signifies success
            of the request.
        :param timeout:
            The socket level timeout in seconds.
        :param headers:
            Add custom HTTP headers to a request in the format of a YAML hash.
            As of Ansible 2.3 supplying `Content-Type` here will override the
            header generated by supplying `json` or `form-urlencoded` for
            `body_format`.
        :param validate_certs:
            If `false`, SSL certificates will not be validated.
            This should only set to `false` used on personally controlled
            sites using self-signed certificates.
            Prior to 1.9.2 the code defaulted to `false`.
        :param client_cert:
            PEM formatted certificate chain file to be used for SSL client
            authentication.
            This file can also include the key as well, and if the key is
            included, `client_key` is not required.
        :param client_key:
            PEM formatted file that contains your private key to be used for
            SSL client authentication.
            If `client_cert` contains both the certificate and key, this
            option is not required.
        :param ca_path:
            PEM formatted file that contains a CA certificate to be used for
            validation.
        :param src:
            Path to file to be submitted to the remote server.
            Cannot be used with `body`.
            Should be used with `force_basic_auth` to ensure success when the
            remote end sends a 401.
        :param remote_src:
            If `false`, the module will search for the `src` on the controller
            node.
            If `true`, the module will search for the `src` on the managed
            (remote) node.
        :param force:
            If `true` do not get a cached copy.
        :param use_proxy:
            If `false`, it will not use a proxy, even if one is defined in an
            environment variable on the target hosts.
        :param unix_socket:
            Path to Unix domain socket to use for connection.
        :param http_agent:
            Header to identify as, generally appears in web server logs.
        :param unredirected_headers:
            A list of header names that will not be sent on subsequent
            redirected requests. This list is case insensitive. By default all
            headers will be redirected. In some cases it may be beneficial to
            list headers such as `Authorization` here to avoid potential
            credential exposure.
        :param use_gssapi:
            Use GSSAPI to perform the authentication, typically this is for
            Kerberos or Kerberos through Negotiate authentication.
            Requires the Python library `gssapi
            <https://github.com/pythongssapi/python-gssapi>`__ to be installed.
            Credentials for GSSAPI can be specified with
            `url_username`/`url_password` or with the GSSAPI env var
            `KRB5CCNAME` that specified a custom Kerberos credential cache.
            NTLM authentication is **not** supported even if the GSSAPI mech
            for NTLM has been installed.
        :param use_netrc:
            Determining whether to use credentials from ``~/.netrc`` file.
            By default .netrc is used with Basic authentication headers.
            When set to False, .netrc credentials are ignored.
            Requires ansible-core >= 2.14
        :param mode:
            The permissions the resulting filesystem object should have.
            For those used to */usr/bin/chmod* remember that modes are
            actually octal numbers. You must give Ansible enough information
            to parse them correctly. For consistent results, quote octal
            numbers (for example, `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a
            string and can do its own conversion from string into number.
            Adding a leading zero (for example, `0755`) works sometimes, but
            can fail in loops and some other circumstances.
            Giving Ansible a number without following either of these rules
            will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected
            results.
            As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode
            (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`).
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does not** exist, the default `umask` on the system will be used
            when setting the mode for the newly created filesystem object.
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does** exist, the mode of the existing filesystem object will be
            used.
            Specifying `mode` is the best way to ensure filesystem objects are
            created with the correct permissions. See CVE-2020-1736 for
            further details.
        :param owner:
            Name of the user that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current user unless you are
            root, in which case it can preserve the previous ownership.
            Specifying a numeric username will be assumed to be a user ID and
            not a username. Avoid numeric usernames to avoid this confusion.
        :param group:
            Name of the group that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current group of the current
            user unless you are root, in which case it can preserve the
            previous ownership.
        :param seuser:
            The user part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            By default it uses the `system` policy, where applicable.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `user` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param serole:
            The role part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `role` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param setype:
            The type part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param selevel:
            The level part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param unsafe_writes:
            Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption
            or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem object.
            By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data
            corruption or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem
            objects, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in

        :param name:
            Name of the user to create, remove or modify.
        :param uid:
            Optionally sets the *UID* of the user.
        :param comment:
            Optionally sets the description (aka *GECOS*) of user account.
            On macOS, this defaults to the `name` option.
        :param hidden:
            macOS only, optionally hide the user from the login window and
            system preferences.
            The default will be `true` if the `system` option is used.
        :param non_unique:
            Optionally when used with the -u option, this option allows to
            change the user ID to a non-unique value.
        :param seuser:
            Optionally sets the seuser type (user_u) on selinux enabled
            systems.
        :param group:
            Optionally sets the user's primary group (takes a group name).
            On macOS, this defaults to `'staff'`.
        :param groups:
            A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of.
            By default, the user is removed from all other groups. Configure
            `append` to modify this.
            When set to an empty string `''`, the user is removed from all
            groups except the primary group.
            Before Ansible 2.3, the only input format allowed was a comma
            separated string.
        :param append:
            If `true`, add the user to the groups specified in `groups`.
            If `false`, user will only be added to the groups specified in
            `groups`, removing them from all other groups.
        :param shell:
            Optionally set the user's shell.
            On macOS, before Ansible 2.5, the default shell for non-system
            users was `/usr/bin/false`. Since Ansible 2.5, the default shell
            for non-system users on macOS is `/bin/bash`.
            On other operating systems, the default shell is determined by the
            underlying tool invoked by this module. See Notes for a per
            platform list of invoked tools.
        :param home:
            Optionally set the user's home directory.
        :param skeleton:
            Optionally set a home skeleton directory.
            Requires `create_home` option!.
        :param password:
            If provided, set the user's password to the provided encrypted
            hash (Linux) or plain text password (macOS).
            **Linux/Unix/POSIX:** Enter the hashed password as the value.
            See `FAQ entry
            <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/faq.html#how-do-i-generate-encrypted-passwords-for-the-user-module>`__
            for details on various ways to generate the hash of a password.
            To create an account with a locked/disabled password on Linux
            systems, set this to `'!'` or `'*'`.
            To create an account with a locked/disabled password on OpenBSD,
            set this to `'*************'`.
            **OS X/macOS:** Enter the cleartext password as the value. Be sure
            to take relevant security precautions.
            On macOS, the password specified in the `password` option will
            always be set, regardless of whether the user account already
            exists or not.
            When the password is passed as an argument, the `user` module will
            always return changed to `true` for macOS systems. Since macOS no
            longer provides access to the hashed passwords directly.
        :param state:
            Whether the account should exist or not, taking action if the
            state is different from what is stated.
            See this `FAQ entry
            <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/faq.html#running-on-macos-as-a-target>`__
            for additional requirements when removing users on macOS systems.
        :param create_home:
            Unless set to `false`, a home directory will be made for the user
            when the account is created or if the home directory does not
            exist.
            Changed from `createhome` to `create_home` in Ansible 2.5.
        :param move_home:
            If set to `true` when used with `home`, attempt to move the user's
            old home directory to the specified directory if it isn't there
            already and the old home exists.
        :param system:
            When creating an account `state=present`, setting this to `true`
            makes the user a system account.
            This setting cannot be changed on existing users.
        :param force:
            This only affects `state=absent`, it forces removal of the user
            and associated directories on supported platforms.
            The behavior is the same as `userdel --force`, check the man page
            for `userdel` on your system for details and support.
            When used with `generate_ssh_key=yes` this forces an existing key
            to be overwritten.
        :param remove:
            This only affects `state=absent`, it attempts to remove
            directories associated with the user.
            The behavior is the same as `userdel --remove`, check the man page
            for details and support.
        :param login_class:
            Optionally sets the user's login class, a feature of most BSD OSs.
        :param generate_ssh_key:
            Whether to generate a SSH key for the user in question.
            This will **not** overwrite an existing SSH key unless used with
            `force=yes`.
        :param ssh_key_bits:
            Optionally specify number of bits in SSH key to create.
            The default value depends on ssh-keygen.
        :param ssh_key_type:
            Optionally specify the type of SSH key to generate.
            Available SSH key types will depend on implementation present on
            target host.
        :param ssh_key_file:
            Optionally specify the SSH key filename.
            If this is a relative filename then it will be relative to the
            user's home directory.
            This parameter defaults to `.ssh/id_rsa`.
        :param ssh_key_comment:
            Optionally define the comment for the SSH key.
        :param ssh_key_passphrase:
            Set a passphrase for the SSH key.
            If no passphrase is provided, the SSH key will default to having
            no passphrase.
        :param update_password:
            `always` will update passwords if they differ.
            `on_create` will only set the password for newly created users.
        :param expires:
            An expiry time for the user in epoch, it will be ignored on
            platforms that do not support this.
            Currently supported on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and DragonFlyBSD.
            Since Ansible 2.6 you can remove the expiry time by specifying a
            negative value. Currently supported on GNU/Linux and FreeBSD.
        :param password_lock:
            Lock the password (`usermod -L`, `usermod -U`, `pw lock`).
            Implementation differs by platform. This option does not always
            mean the user cannot login using other methods.
            This option does not disable the user, only lock the password.
            This must be set to `False` in order to unlock a currently locked
            password. The absence of this parameter will not unlock a password.
            Currently supported on Linux, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD, NetBSD,
            OpenBSD.
        :param local:
            Forces the use of "local" command alternatives on platforms that
            implement it.
            This is useful in environments that use centralized authentication
            when you want to manipulate the local users (in other words, it
            uses `luseradd` instead of `useradd`).
            This will check `/etc/passwd` for an existing account before
            invoking commands. If the local account database exists somewhere
            other than `/etc/passwd`, this setting will not work properly.
            This requires that the above commands as well as `/etc/passwd`
            must exist on the target host, otherwise it will be a fatal error.
        :param profile:
            Sets the profile of the user.
            Can set multiple profiles using comma separation.
            To delete all the profiles, use `profile=''`.
            Currently supported on Illumos/Solaris. Does nothing when used
            with other platforms.
        :param authorization:
            Sets the authorization of the user.
            Can set multiple authorizations using comma separation.
            To delete all authorizations, use `authorization=''`.
            Currently supported on Illumos/Solaris. Does nothing when used
            with other platforms.
        :param role:
            Sets the role of the user.
            Can set multiple roles using comma separation.
            To delete all roles, use `role=''`.
            Currently supported on Illumos/Solaris. Does nothing when used
            with other platforms.
        :param password_expire_max:
            Maximum number of days between password change.
            Supported on Linux only.
        :param password_expire_min:
            Minimum number of days between password change.
            Supported on Linux only.
        :param password_expire_warn:
            Number of days of warning before password expires.
            Supported on Linux only.
            Requires ansible-core >= 2.16
        :param umask:
            Sets the umask of the user.
            Currently supported on Linux. Does nothing when used with other
            platforms.
            Requires `local` is omitted or `False`.

            This module supports `yum` (as it always has), this is known as
            `yum3`/`YUM3`/`yum-deprecated` by upstream yum developers. As of
            Ansible 2.7+, this module also supports `YUM4`, which is the "new
            yum" and it has an `dnf` backend.
            By default, this module will select the backend based on the
            `ansible_pkg_mgr` fact.
        :param name:
            A package name or package specifier with version, like `name-1.0`.
            If a previous version is specified, the task also needs to turn
            `allow_downgrade` on. See the `allow_downgrade` documentation for
            caveats with downgrading packages.
            When using state=latest, this can be `'*'` which means run
            `yum -y update`.
            You can also pass a url or a local path to a rpm file (using
            state=present). To operate on several packages this can accept a
            comma separated string of packages or (as of 2.0) a list of
            packages.
        :param exclude:
            Package name(s) to exclude when state=present, or latest.
        :param list:
            Package name to run the equivalent of yum list --show-duplicates
            <package> against. In addition to listing packages, use can also
            list the following: `installed`, `updates`, `available` and
            `repos`.
            This parameter is mutually exclusive with `name`.
        :param state:
            Whether to install (`present` or `installed`, `latest`), or remove
            (`absent` or `removed`) a package.
            `present` and `installed` will simply ensure that a desired
            package is installed.
            `latest` will update the specified package if it's not of the
            latest available version.
            `absent` and `removed` will remove the specified package.
            Default is `None`, however in effect the default action is
            `present` unless the `autoremove` option is enabled for this
            module, then `absent` is inferred.

            When specifying multiple repos, separate them with a `","`.
            As of Ansible 2.7, this can alternatively be a list instead of
            `","` separated string.
        :param disablerepo:
            *Repoid* of repositories to disable for the install/update

            When specifying multiple repos, separate them with a `","`.
            As of Ansible 2.7, this can alternatively be a list instead of
            `","` separated string.
        :param conf_file:
            The remote yum configuration file to use for the transaction.
        :param disable_gpg_check:
            Whether to disable the GPG checking of signatures of packages
            being installed. Has an effect only if state is *present* or
            *latest*.

            Skip packages with broken dependencies(devsolve) and are causing
            problems.
        :param update_cache:
            Force yum to check if cache is out of date and redownload if
            needed. Has an effect only if state is *present* or *latest*.
        :param validate_certs:
            This only applies if using a https url as the source of the rpm.
            e.g. for localinstall. If set to `False`, the SSL certificates
            will not be validated.
            This should only set to `False` used on personally controlled
            sites using self-signed certificates as it avoids verifying the
            source site.
            Prior to 2.1 the code worked as if this was set to `True`.
        :param update_only:
            When using latest, only update installed packages. Do not install
            packages.
            Has an effect only if state is *latest*.
        :param installroot:
            Specifies an alternative installroot, relative to which all
            packages will be installed.
        :param security:
            If set to `True`, and `state=latest` then only installs updates
            that have been marked security related.
        :param bugfix:
            If set to `True`, and `state=latest` then only installs updates
            that have been marked bugfix related.
        :param allow_downgrade:
            Specify if the named package and version is allowed to downgrade a
            maybe already installed higher version of that package. Note that
            setting allow_downgrade=True can make this module behave in a
            non-idempotent way. The task could end up with a set of packages
            that does not match the complete list of specified packages to
            install (because dependencies between the downgraded package and
            others can cause changes to the packages which were in the earlier
            transaction).
        :param enable_plugin:
            *Plugin* name to enable for the install/update operation. The
            enabled plugin will not persist beyond the transaction.
        :param disable_plugin:
            *Plugin* name to disable for the install/update operation. The
            disabled plugins will not persist beyond the transaction.
        :param releasever:
            Specifies an alternative release from which all packages will be
            installed.
        :param autoremove:
            If `True`, removes all "leaf" packages from the system that were
            originally installed as dependencies of user-installed packages
            but which are no longer required by any such package. Should be
            used alone or when state is *absent*.
            NOTE: This feature requires yum >= 3.4.3 (RHEL/CentOS 7+).
        :param disable_excludes:
            Disable the excludes defined in YUM config files.
            If set to `all`, disables all excludes.
            If set to `main`, disable excludes defined in [main] in yum.conf.
            If set to `repoid`, disable excludes defined for given repo id.
        :param download_only:
            Only download the packages, do not install them.
        :param lock_timeout:
            Amount of time to wait for the yum lockfile to be freed.
        :param install_weak_deps:
            Will also install all packages linked by a weak dependency
            relation.
            NOTE: This feature requires yum >= 4 (RHEL/CentOS 8+).
        :param download_dir:
            Specifies an alternate directory to store packages.
            Has an effect only if *download_only* is specified.
        :param install_repoquery:
            If repoquery is not available, install yum-utils. If the system is
            registered to RHN or an RHN Satellite, repoquery allows for
            querying all channels assigned to the system. It is also required
            to use the 'list' parameter.
            NOTE: This will run and be logged as a separate yum transation
            which takes place before any other installation or removal.
            NOTE: This will use the system's default enabled repositories
            without regard for disablerepo/enablerepo given to the module.

        .. seealso::
            :ref:`ansible.builtin <ansible_collections.ansible.builtin.yum_repository_module>`

        :param async:
            If set to `true` Yum will download packages and metadata from this
            repo in parallel, if possible.
            In ansible-core 2.11, 2.12, and 2.13 the default value is `true`.
            This option has been deprecated in RHEL 8. If you're using one of
            the versions listed above, you can set this option to None to
            avoid passing an unknown configuration option.
        :param bandwidth:
            Maximum available network bandwidth in bytes/second. Used with the
            `throttle` option.
            If `throttle` is a percentage and bandwidth is `0` then bandwidth
            throttling will be disabled. If `throttle` is expressed as a data
            rate (bytes/sec) then this option is ignored. Default is `0` (no
            bandwidth throttling).
        :param baseurl:
            URL to the directory where the yum repository's 'repodata'
            directory lives.
            It can also be a list of multiple URLs.
            This, the `metalink` or `mirrorlist` parameters are required if
            `state` is set to `present`.
        :param cost:
            Relative cost of accessing this repository. Useful for weighing
            one repo's packages as greater/less than any other.
        :param deltarpm_metadata_percentage:
            When the relative size of deltarpm metadata vs pkgs is larger than
            this, deltarpm metadata is not downloaded from the repo. Note that
            you can give values over `100`, so `200` means that the metadata
            is required to be half the size of the packages. Use `0` to turn
            off this check, and always download metadata.
        :param deltarpm_percentage:
            When the relative size of delta vs pkg is larger than this, delta
            is not used. Use `0` to turn off delta rpm processing. Local
            repositories (with file://`baseurl`) have delta rpms turned off by
            default.
        :param description:
            A human-readable string describing the repository. This option
            corresponds to the "name" property in the repo file.
            This parameter is only required if `state` is set to `present`.
        :param enabled:
            This tells yum whether or not use this repository.
            Yum default value is `true`.
        :param enablegroups:
            Determines whether yum will allow the use of package groups for
            this repository.
            Yum default value is `true`.
        :param exclude:
            List of packages to exclude from updates or installs. This should
            be a space separated list. Shell globs using wildcards (for
            example `*` and `?`) are allowed.
            The list can also be a regular YAML array.
        :param failovermethod:
            `roundrobin` randomly selects a URL out of the list of URLs to
            start with and proceeds through each of them as it encounters a
            failure contacting the host.
            `priority` starts from the first `baseurl` listed and reads
            through them sequentially.
        :param file:
            File name without the `.repo` extension to save the repo in.
            Defaults to the value of `name`.
        :param gpgcakey:
            A URL pointing to the ASCII-armored CA key file for the repository.
        :param gpgcheck:
            Tells yum whether or not it should perform a GPG signature check
            on packages.
            No default setting. If the value is not set, the system setting
            from `/etc/yum.conf` or system default of `false` will be used.
        :param gpgkey:
            A URL pointing to the ASCII-armored GPG key file for the
            repository.
            It can also be a list of multiple URLs.
        :param module_hotfixes:
            Disable module RPM filtering and make all RPMs from the repository
            available. The default is `None`.
        :param http_caching:
            Determines how upstream HTTP caches are instructed to handle any
            HTTP downloads that Yum does.
            `all` means that all HTTP downloads should be cached.
            `packages` means that only RPM package downloads should be cached
            (but not repository metadata downloads).
            `none` means that no HTTP downloads should be cached.
        :param include:
            Include external configuration file. Both, local path and URL is
            supported. Configuration file will be inserted at the position of
            the `include=` line. Included files may contain further include
            lines. Yum will abort with an error if an inclusion loop is
            detected.
        :param includepkgs:
            List of packages you want to only use from a repository. This
            should be a space separated list. Shell globs using wildcards (for
            example `*` and `?`) are allowed. Substitution variables (for
            example `$releasever`) are honored here.
            The list can also be a regular YAML array.
        :param ip_resolve:
            Determines how yum resolves host names.
            `4` or `IPv4` - resolve to IPv4 addresses only.
            `6` or `IPv6` - resolve to IPv6 addresses only.
        :param keepalive:
            This tells yum whether or not HTTP/1.1 keepalive should be used
            with this repository. This can improve transfer speeds by using
            one connection when downloading multiple files from a repository.
        :param keepcache:
            Either `1` or `0`. Determines whether or not yum keeps the cache
            of headers and packages after successful installation.
            This parameter is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.20.
        :param metadata_expire:
            Time (in seconds) after which the metadata will expire.
            Default value is 6 hours.
        :param metadata_expire_filter:
            Filter the `metadata_expire` time, allowing a trade of speed for
            accuracy if a command doesn't require it. Each yum command can
            specify that it requires a certain level of timeliness quality
            from the remote repos. from "I'm about to install/upgrade, so this
            better be current" to "Anything that's available is good enough".
            `never` - Nothing is filtered, always obey `metadata_expire`.
            `read-only:past` - Commands that only care about past information
            are filtered from metadata expiring. Eg. `yum history` info (if
            history needs to lookup anything about a previous transaction,
            then by definition the remote package was available in the past).
            `read-only:present` - Commands that are balanced between past and
            future. Eg. `yum list yum`.
            `read-only:future` - Commands that are likely to result in running
            other commands which will require the latest metadata. Eg.
            `yum check-update`.
            Note that this option does not override "yum clean expire-cache".
        :param metalink:
            Specifies a URL to a metalink file for the repomd.xml, a list of
            mirrors for the entire repository are generated by converting the
            mirrors for the repomd.xml file to a `baseurl`.
            This, the `baseurl` or `mirrorlist` parameters are required if
            `state` is set to `present`.
        :param mirrorlist:
            Specifies a URL to a file containing a list of baseurls.
            This, the `baseurl` or `metalink` parameters are required if
            `state` is set to `present`.
        :param mirrorlist_expire:
            Time (in seconds) after which the mirrorlist locally cached will
            expire.
            Default value is 6 hours.
        :param name:
            Unique repository ID. This option builds the section name of the
            repository in the repo file.
            This parameter is only required if `state` is set to `present` or
            `absent`.
        :param password:
            Password to use with the username for basic authentication.
        :param priority:
            Enforce ordered protection of repositories. The value is an
            integer from 1 to 99.
            This option only works if the YUM Priorities plugin is installed.
        :param protect:
            Protect packages from updates from other repositories.
        :param proxy:
            URL to the proxy server that yum should use. Set to `_none_` to
            disable the global proxy setting.
        :param proxy_password:
            Password for this proxy.
        :param proxy_username:
            Username to use for proxy.
        :param repo_gpgcheck:
            This tells yum whether or not it should perform a GPG signature
            check on the repodata from this repository.
        :param reposdir:
            Directory where the `.repo` files will be stored.
        :param retries:
            Set the number of times any attempt to retrieve a file should
            retry before returning an error. Setting this to `0` makes yum try
            forever.
        :param s3_enabled:
            Enables support for S3 repositories.
            This option only works if the YUM S3 plugin is installed.
        :param skip_if_unavailable:
            If set to `true` yum will continue running if this repository
            cannot be contacted for any reason. This should be set carefully
            as all repos are consulted for any given command.
        :param ssl_check_cert_permissions:
            Whether yum should check the permissions on the paths for the
            certificates on the repository (both remote and local).
            If we can't read any of the files then yum will force
            `skip_if_unavailable` to be `true`. This is most useful for
            non-root processes which use yum on repos that have client cert
            files which are readable only by root.
        :param sslcacert:
            Path to the directory containing the databases of the certificate
            authorities yum should use to verify SSL certificates.
        :param sslclientcert:
            Path to the SSL client certificate yum should use to connect to
            repos/remote sites.
        :param sslclientkey:
            Path to the SSL client key yum should use to connect to
            repos/remote sites.
        :param sslverify:
            Defines whether yum should verify SSL certificates/hosts at all.
        :param state:
            State of the repo file.
        :param throttle:
            Enable bandwidth throttling for downloads.
            This option can be expressed as a absolute data rate in bytes/sec.
            An SI prefix (k, M or G) may be appended to the bandwidth value.
        :param timeout:
            Number of seconds to wait for a connection before timing out.
        :param ui_repoid_vars:
            When a repository id is displayed, append these yum variables to
            the string if they are used in the `baseurl`/etc. Variables are
            appended in the order listed (and found).
        :param username:
            Username to use for basic authentication to a repo or really any
            url.
        :param mode:
            The permissions the resulting filesystem object should have.
            For those used to */usr/bin/chmod* remember that modes are
            actually octal numbers. You must give Ansible enough information
            to parse them correctly. For consistent results, quote octal
            numbers (for example, `'644'` or `'1777'`) so Ansible receives a
            string and can do its own conversion from string into number.
            Adding a leading zero (for example, `0755`) works sometimes, but
            can fail in loops and some other circumstances.
            Giving Ansible a number without following either of these rules
            will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected
            results.
            As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode
            (for example, `u+rwx` or `u=rw,g=r,o=r`).
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does not** exist, the default `umask` on the system will be used
            when setting the mode for the newly created filesystem object.
            If `mode` is not specified and the destination filesystem object
            **does** exist, the mode of the existing filesystem object will be
            used.
            Specifying `mode` is the best way to ensure filesystem objects are
            created with the correct permissions. See CVE-2020-1736 for
            further details.
        :param owner:
            Name of the user that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current user unless you are
            root, in which case it can preserve the previous ownership.
            Specifying a numeric username will be assumed to be a user ID and
            not a username. Avoid numeric usernames to avoid this confusion.
        :param group:
            Name of the group that should own the filesystem object, as would
            be fed to *chown*.
            When left unspecified, it uses the current group of the current
            user unless you are root, in which case it can preserve the
            previous ownership.
        :param seuser:
            The user part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            By default it uses the `system` policy, where applicable.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `user` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param serole:
            The role part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `role` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param setype:
            The type part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `type` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param selevel:
            The level part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the `range`.
            When set to `_default`, it will use the `level` portion of the
            policy if available.
        :param unsafe_writes:
            Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption
            or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem object.
            By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data
            corruption or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem
            objects, but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in
            ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted filesystem
            objects, which cannot be updated atomically from inside the
            container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
            This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of
            updating filesystem objects when atomic operations fail (however,
            it doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).
            IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can
            lead to data corruption.
        :param attributes:
            The attributes the resulting filesystem object should have.
            To get supported flags look at the man page for *chattr* on the
            target system.
            This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the
            one displayed by *lsattr*.
            The `=` operator is assumed as default, otherwise `+` or `-`
            operators need to be included in the string.

        :param config:
            The config to be pushed to the network device. This argument is
            mutually exclusive with `rollback` and either one of the option
            should be given as input. To ensure idempotency and correct diff
            the configuration lines should be similar to how they appear if
            present in the running configuration on device including the
            indentation.
        :param commit:
            The `commit` argument instructs the module to push the
            configuration to the device. This is mapped to module check mode.
        :param replace:
            If the `replace` argument is set to `True`, it will replace the
            entire running-config of the device with the `config` argument
            value. For devices that support replacing running configuration
            from file on device like NXOS/JUNOS, the `replace` argument takes
            path to the file on the device that will be used for replacing the
            entire running-config. The value of `config` option should be
            *None* for such devices. Nexus 9K devices only support replace.
            Use *net_put* or *nxos_file_copy* in case of NXOS module to copy
            the flat file to remote device and then use set the fullpath to
            this argument.
        :param backup:
            This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the
            current running config from the remote device before any changes
            are made. If the `backup_options` value is not given, the backup
            file is written to the `backup` folder in the playbook root
            directory or role root directory, if playbook is part of an
            ansible role. If the directory does not exist, it is created.
        :param rollback:
            The `rollback` argument instructs the module to rollback the
            current configuration to the identifier specified in the argument.
            If the specified rollback identifier does not exist on the remote
            device, the module will fail. To rollback to the most recent
            commit, set the `rollback` argument to 0. This option is mutually
            exclusive with `config`.
        :param commit_comment:
            The `commit_comment` argument specifies a text string to be used
            when committing the configuration. If the `commit` argument is set
            to False, this argument is silently ignored. This argument is only
            valid for the platforms that support commit operation with comment.
        :param defaults:
            The *defaults* argument will influence how the running-config is
            collected from the device. When the value is set to true, the
            command used to collect the running-config is append with the all
            keyword. When the value is set to false, the command is issued
            without the all keyword.
        :param multiline_delimiter:
            This argument is used when pushing a multiline configuration
            element to the device. It specifies the character to use as the
            delimiting character. This only applies to the configuration
            action.
        :param diff_replace:
            Instructs the module on the way to perform the configuration on
            the device. If the `diff_replace` argument is set to *line* then
            the modified lines are pushed to the device in configuration mode.
            If the argument is set to *block* then the entire command block is
            pushed to the device in configuration mode if any line is not
            correct. Note that this parameter will be ignored if the platform
            has onbox diff support.
        :param diff_match:
            Instructs the module on the way to perform the matching of the set
            of commands against the current device config. If `diff_match` is
            set to *line*, commands are matched line by line. If `diff_match`
            is set to *strict*, command lines are matched with respect to
            position. If `diff_match` is set to *exact*, command lines must be
            an equal match. Finally, if `diff_match` is set to *none*, the
            module will not attempt to compare the source configuration with
            the running configuration on the remote device. Note that this
            parameter will be ignored if the platform has onbox diff support.
        :param diff_ignore_lines:
            Use this argument to specify one or more lines that should be
            ignored during the diff. This is used for lines in the
            configuration that are automatically updated by the system. This
            argument takes a list of regular expressions or exact line
            matches. Note that this parameter will be ignored if the platform
            has onbox diff support.

            The configuration data as defined by the device's data models, the
            value can be either in xml string format or text format or python
            dictionary representation of JSON format.

            the xml value should have *config* as root tag.

            Name of the configuration datastore to be edited. - auto, uses
            candidate and fallback to running - candidate, edit <candidate/>
            datastore and then commit - running, edit <running/> datastore
            directly.

            Name of the configuration datastore to use as the source to copy
            the configuration to the datastore mentioned by `target` option.
            The values can be either *running*, *candidate*, *startup* or a
            remote URL.
        :param format:
            The format of the configuration provided as value of `content`.
            In case of json string format it will be converted to the
            corresponding xml string using xmltodict library before pushing
            onto the remote host.
            In case of *text* format of the configuration should be supported
            by remote Netconf server.
            If the value of `format` options is not given it tries to guess
            the data format of `content` option as one of *xml* or *json* or
            *text*.
            If the data format is not identified it is set to *xml* by default.
        :param lock:
            Instructs the module to explicitly lock the datastore specified as
            `target`. By setting the option value *always* is will explicitly
            lock the datastore mentioned in `target` option. It the value is
            *never* it will not lock the `target` datastore. The value
            *if-supported* lock the `target` datastore only if it is supported
            by the remote Netconf server.
        :param default_operation:
            The default operation for <edit-config> rpc, valid values are
            *merge*, *replace* and *none*. If the default value is merge, the
            configuration data in the `content` option is merged at the
            corresponding level in the `target` datastore. If the value is
            replace the data in the `content` option completely replaces the
            configuration in the `target` datastore. If the value is none the
            `target` datastore is unaffected by the configuration in the
            config option, unless and until the incoming configuration data
            uses the `operation` operation to request a different operation.
        :param confirm:
            This argument will configure a timeout value for the commit to be
            confirmed before it is automatically rolled back. If the
            `confirm_commit` argument is set to False, this argument is
            silently ignored. If the value of this argument is set to 0, the
            commit is confirmed immediately. The remote host MUST support
            :candidate and :confirmed-commit capability for this option to .
        :param confirm_commit:
            This argument will execute commit operation on remote device. It
            can be used to confirm a previous commit.
        :param error_option:
            This option controls the netconf server action after an error
            occurs while editing the configuration.
            If *error_option=stop-on-error*, abort the config edit on first
            error.
            If *error_option=continue-on-error*, continue to process
            configuration data on error. The error is recorded and negative
            response is generated if any errors occur.
            If *error_option=rollback-on-error*, rollback to the original
            configuration if any error occurs. This requires the remote
            Netconf server to support the *error_option=rollback-on-error*
            capability.
        :param save:
            The `save` argument instructs the module to save the configuration
            in `target` datastore to the startup-config if changed and if
            :startup capability is supported by Netconf server.
        :param backup:
            This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the
            current `running-config` from the remote device before any changes
            are made. If the `backup_options` value is not given, the backup
            file is written to the `backup` folder in the playbook root
            directory or role root directory, if playbook is part of an
            ansible role. If the directory does not exist, it is created.
        :param delete:
            It instructs the module to delete the configuration from value
            mentioned in `target` datastore.
        :param commit:
            This boolean flag controls if the configuration changes should be
            committed or not after editing the candidate datastore. This
            option is supported only if remote Netconf server supports
            :candidate capability. If the value is set to *False* commit won't
            be issued after edit-config operation and user needs to handle
            commit or discard-changes explicitly.
        :param validate:
            This boolean flag if set validates the content of datastore given
            in `target` option. For this option to work remote Netconf server
            should support :validate capability.
        :param backup_options:
            This is a dict object containing configurable options related to
            backup file path. The value of this option is read only when
            `backup` is set to *True*, if `backup` is set to *False* this
            option will be silently ignored.
        :param get_filter:
            This argument specifies the XML string which acts as a filter to
            restrict the portions of the data retrieved from the remote device
            when comparing the before and after state of the device following
            calls to edit_config. When not specified, the entire configuration
            or state data is returned for comparison depending on the value of
            `source` option. The `get_filter` value can be either XML string
            or XPath or JSON string or native python dictionary, if the filter
            is in XPath format the NETCONF server running on remote host
            should support xpath capability else it will result in an error.

            separating them by newlines.
            This option is not loop aware, so if you use `with_` , it will be
            exclusive per iteration of the loop.

            runs.
            Deprecated on Solaris systems. Has no effect when used with
            `ephemeral`.
        :param state:
            If `mounted`, the device will be actively mounted and
            appropriately configured in *fstab*. If the mount point is not
            present, the mount point will be created.
            If `unmounted`, the device will be unmounted without changing
            *fstab*.
            `present` only specifies that the device is to be configured in
            *fstab* and does not trigger or require a mount.
            `ephemeral` only specifies that the device is to be mounted,
            without changing *fstab*. If it is already mounted, a remount will
            be triggered. This will always return changed=True. If the mount
            point *path* has already a device mounted on, and its source is
            different than *src*, the module will fail to avoid unexpected
            unmount or mount point override. If the mount point is not
            present, the mount point will be created. The *fstab* is
            completely ignored. This option is added in version 1.5.0.
            `absent` specifies that the device mount's entry will be removed
            from *fstab* and will also unmount the device and remove the mount
            point.
            `remounted` specifies that the device will be remounted for when
            you want to force a refresh on the mount itself (added in 2.9).
            This will always return changed=true. If *opts* is set, the
            options will be applied to the remount, but will not change
            *fstab*. Additionally, if *opts* is set, and the remount command
            fails, the module will error to prevent unexpected mount changes.
            Try using `mounted` instead to work around this issue. `remounted`
            expects the mount point to be present in the *fstab*. To remount a
            mount point not registered in *fstab*, use `ephemeral` instead,
            especially with BSD nodes.
            `absent_from_fstab` specifies that the device mount's entry will
            be removed from *fstab*. This option does not unmount it or delete
            the mountpoint.
        :param fstab:
            File to use instead of `/etc/fstab`.
            You should not use this option unless you really know what you are
            doing.
            This might be useful if you need to configure mountpoints in a
            chroot environment.
            OpenBSD does not allow specifying alternate fstab files with mount
            so do not use this on OpenBSD with any state that operates on the
            live filesystem.
            This parameter defaults to /etc/fstab or /etc/vfstab on Solaris.
            This parameter is ignored when *state* is set to `ephemeral`.
        :param boot:
            Determines if the filesystem should be mounted on boot.
            Only applies to Solaris and Linux systems.
            For Solaris systems, `true` will set `True` as the value of mount
            at boot in */etc/vfstab*.
            For Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD systems, `false` will add
            `noauto` to mount options in */etc/fstab*.
            To avoid mount option conflicts, if `noauto` specified in `opts`,
            mount module will ignore `boot`.
            This parameter is ignored when *state* is set to `ephemeral`.

        :param src:
            Path on the source host that will be synchronized to the

            The path can be absolute or relative.
        :param dest:
            Path on the destination host that will be synchronized from the
            source.
            The path can be absolute or relative.
        :param dest_port:
            Port number for ssh on the destination host.
            Prior to Ansible 2.0, the ansible_ssh_port inventory var took
            precedence over this value.
            This parameter defaults to the value of `ansible_port`, the
            `remote_port` config setting or the value from ssh client
            configuration if none of the former have been set.
        :param mode:
            Specify the direction of the synchronization.
            In push mode the localhost or delegate is the source.
            In pull mode the remote host in context is the source.
        :param archive:
            Mirrors the rsync archive flag, enables recursive, links, perms,
            times, owner, group flags and -D.
        :param checksum:
            Skip based on checksum, rather than mod-time & size; Note that
            that "archive" option is still enabled by default - the "checksum"
            option will not disable it.
        :param compress:
            Compress file data during the transfer.
            In most cases, leave this enabled unless it causes problems.
        :param existing_only:
            Skip creating new files on receiver.
        :param delete:
            Delete files in *dest* that do not exist (after transfer, not
            before) in the *src* path.
            This option requires *recursive=true*.
            This option ignores excluded files and behaves like the rsync opt
            `--delete-after`.
        :param dirs:
            Transfer directories without recursing.
        :param recursive:
            Recurse into directories.
            This parameter defaults to the value of the archive option.
        :param links:
            Copy symlinks as symlinks.
            This parameter defaults to the value of the archive option.
        :param copy_links:
            Copy symlinks as the item that they point to (the referent) is
            copied, rather than the symlink.
        :param perms:
            Preserve permissions.
            This parameter defaults to the value of the archive option.
        :param times:
            Preserve modification times.
            This parameter defaults to the value of the archive option.
        :param owner:
            Preserve owner (super user only).
            This parameter defaults to the value of the archive option.
        :param group:
            Preserve group.
            This parameter defaults to the value of the archive option.
        :param rsync_path:
            Specify the rsync command to run on the remote host. See
            `--rsync-path` on the rsync man page.
            To specify the rsync command to run on the local host, you need to
            set this your task var `ansible_rsync_path`.
        :param rsync_timeout:
            Specify a `--timeout` for the rsync command in seconds.
        :param set_remote_user:
            Put user@ for the remote paths.
            If you have a custom ssh config to define the remote user for a
            host that does not match the inventory user, you should set this
            parameter to `false`.
        :param use_ssh_args:
            In Ansible 2.10 and lower, it uses the ssh_args specified in
            `ansible.cfg`.
            In Ansible 2.11 and onwards, when set to `true`, it uses all SSH
            connection configurations like `ansible_ssh_args`,
            `ansible_ssh_common_args`, and `ansible_ssh_extra_args`.
        :param ssh_connection_multiplexing:
            SSH connection multiplexing for rsync is disabled by default to
            prevent misconfigured ControlSockets from resulting in failed SSH
            connections. This is accomplished by setting the SSH
            `ControlSocket` to `none`.
            Set this option to `true` to allow multiplexing and reduce SSH
            connection overhead.
            Note that simply setting this option to `true` is not enough; You
            must also configure SSH connection multiplexing in your SSH client
            config by setting values for `ControlMaster`, `ControlPersist` and
            `ControlPath`.
        :param rsync_opts:
            Specify additional rsync options by passing in an array.
            Note that an empty string in `rsync_opts` will end up transfer the
            current working directory.
        :param partial:
            Tells rsync to keep the partial file which should make a
            subsequent transfer of the rest of the file much faster.
        :param verify_host:
            Verify destination host key.
        :param private_key:
            Specify the private key to use for SSH-based rsync connections
            (e.g. `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
        :param link_dest:
            Add a destination to hard link against during the rsync.
        :param delay_updates:
            This option puts the temporary file from each updated file into a
            holding directory until the end of the transfer, at which time all
            the files are renamed into place in rapid succession.

            various users.
            When set to `user`, the key is stored in a path only accessible by
            the current user.
            Used when `state=present` only and cannot be changed once imported.
            See

            The file type to export the certificate as when `state=exported`.
            `der` is a binary ASN.1 encoded file.
            `pem` is a base64 encoded file of a der file in the OpenSSL form.
            `pkcs12` (also known as pfx) is a binary container that contains
            both the certificate and private key unlike the other options.
            When `pkcs12` is set and the private key is not exportable or
            accessible by the current user, it will throw an exception.

            Other authentication types can set *client_cert_password* when the
            cert is password protected.
        :param client_cert_password:
            The password for *client_cert* if the cert is password protected.
        :param force_basic_auth:
            By default the authentication header is only sent when a
            webservice responses to an initial request with a 401 status.
            Since some basic auth services do not properly send a 401, logins
            will fail.
            This option forces the sending of the Basic authentication header
            upon the original request.
        :param url_username:
            The username to use for authentication.
        :param url_password:
            The password for *url_username*.
        :param use_default_credential:
            Uses the current user's credentials when authenticating with a
            server protected with `NTLM`, `Kerberos`, or `Negotiate`
            authentication.
            Sites that use `Basic` auth will still require explicit
            credentials through the *url_username* and *url_password* options.
            The module will only have access to the user's credentials if
            using `become` with a password, you are connecting with SSH using
            a password, or connecting with WinRM using `CredSSP` or
            `Kerberos with delegation`.
            If not using `become` or a different auth method to the ones
            stated above, there will be no default credentials available and
            no authentication will occur.
        :param use_proxy:
            If `False`, it will not use the proxy defined in IE for the
            current user.
        :param proxy_url:
            An explicit proxy to use for the request.
            By default, the request will use the IE defined proxy unless
            *use_proxy* is set to `False`.
        :param proxy_username:
            The username to use for proxy authentication.
        :param proxy_password:
            The password for *proxy_username*.
        :param proxy_use_default_credential:
            Uses the current user's credentials when authenticating with a
            proxy host protected with `NTLM`, `Kerberos`, or `Negotiate`
            authentication.
            Proxies that use `Basic` auth will still require explicit
            credentials through the *proxy_username* and *proxy_password*
            options.
            The module will only have access to the user's credentials if
            using `become` with a password, you are connecting with SSH using
            a password, or connecting with WinRM using `CredSSP` or
            `Kerberos with delegation`.
            If not using `become` or a different auth method to the ones
            stated above, there will be no default credentials available and
            no proxy authentication will occur.

        :param arguments:
            Any arguments the installer needs to either install or uninstall
            the package.
            If the package is an MSI do not supply the `/qn`, `/log` or
            `/norestart` arguments.
            This is only used for the `msi`, `msp`, and `registry` providers.
            Can be a list of arguments and the module will escape the
            arguments as necessary, it is recommended to use a string when
            dealing with MSI packages due to the unique escaping issues with
            msiexec.
            When using a list of arguments each item in the list is considered
            to be a single argument. As such, if an argument in the list
            contains a space then Ansible will quote this to ensure that this
            is seen by Windows as a single argument. Should this behaviour not
            be what is required, the argument should be split into two
            separate list items. See the examples section for more detail.
        :param chdir:
            Set the specified path as the current working directory before
            installing or uninstalling a package.
            This is only used for the `msi`, `msp`, and `registry` providers.
        :param creates_path:
            Will check the existence of the path specified and use the result
            to determine whether the package is already installed.
            You can use this in conjunction with `product_id` and other
            `creates_*`.
        :param creates_service:
            Will check the existing of the service specified and use the
            result to determine whether the package is already installed.
            You can use this in conjunction with `product_id` and other
            `creates_*`.
        :param creates_version:
            Will check the file version property of the file at `creates_path`
            and use the result to determine whether the package is already
            installed.
            `creates_path` MUST be set and is a file.
            You can use this in conjunction with `product_id` and other
            `creates_*`.
        :param expected_return_code:
            One or more return codes from the package installation that
            indicates success.
            The return codes are read as a signed integer, any values greater
            than 2147483647 need to be represented as the signed equivalent,
            i.e. `4294967295` is `-1`.
            To convert a unsigned number to the signed equivalent you can run
            "[Int32]("0x{0:X}" -f ([UInt32]3221225477))".
            A return code of `3010` usually means that a reboot is required,
            the `reboot_required` return value is set if the return code is
            `3010`.
            This is only used for the `msi`, `msp`, and `registry` providers.
        :param log_path:
            Specifies the path to a log file that is persisted after a package
            is installed or uninstalled.
            This is only used for the `msi` or `msp` provider.
            When omitted, a temporary log file is used instead for those
            providers.
            This is only valid for MSI files, use `arguments` for the
            `registry` provider.
        :param path:
            Location of the package to be installed or uninstalled.
            This package can either be on the local file system, network share
            or a url.
            When `state=present`, `product_id` is not set and the path is a
            URL, this file will always be downloaded to a temporary directory
            for idempotency checks, otherwise the file will only be downloaded
            if the package has not been installed based on the `product_id`
            checks.
            If `state=present` then this value MUST be set.
            If `state=absent` then this value does not need to be set if
            `product_id` is.
        :param product_id:
            The product id of the installed packaged.
            This is used for checking whether the product is already installed
            and getting the uninstall information if `state=absent`.
            For msi packages, this is the `ProductCode` (GUID) of the package.
            This can be found under the same registry paths as the `registry`
            provider.
            For msp packages, this is the `PatchCode` (GUID) of the package
            which can found under the `Details -> Revision number` of the
            file's properties.
            For msix packages, this is the `Name` or `PackageFullName` of the
            package found under the `Get-AppxPackage` cmdlet.
            For registry (exe) packages, this is the registry key name under
            the registry paths specified in *provider*.
            This value is ignored if `path` is set to a local accesible file
            path and the package is not an `exe`.
            This SHOULD be set when the package is an `exe`, or the path is a
            url or a network share and credential delegation is not being
            used. The `creates_*` options can be used instead but is not
            recommended.
        :param provider:
            Set the package provider to use when searching for a package.
            The `auto` provider will select the proper provider if *path*
            otherwise it scans all the other providers based on the
            *product_id*.
            The `msi` provider scans for MSI packages installed on a machine
            wide and current user context based on the `ProductCode` of the
            MSI.
            The `msix` provider is used to install `.appx`, `.msix`,
            `.appxbundle`, or `.msixbundle` packages. These packages are only
            installed or removed on the current use. The host must be set to
            allow sideloaded apps or in developer mode. See the examples for
            how to enable this. If a package is already installed but `path`
            points to an updated package, this will be installed over the top
            of the existing one.
            The `msp` provider scans for all MSP patches installed on a
            machine wide and current user context based on the `PatchCode` of
            the MSP. A `msp` will be applied or removed on all `msi` products
            that it applies to and is installed. If the patch is obsoleted or
            superseded then no action will be taken.
            The `registry` provider is used for traditional `exe` installers
            and uses the following registry path to determine if a product was
            installed;
            `HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall`,
            `HKLM:\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall`,
            `HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall`,
            and
            `HKCU:\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall`.
        :param state:
            Whether to install or uninstall the package.
            The module uses *product_id* to determine whether the package is
            installed or not.
            For all providers but `auto`, the *path* can be used for
            idempotency checks if it is locally accesible filesystem path.
        :param wait_for_children:
            The module will wait for the process it spawns to finish but any
            processes spawned in that child process as ignored.
            Set to `true` to wait for all descendent processes to finish
            before the module returns.
            This is useful if the install/uninstaller is just a wrapper which
            then calls the actual installer as its own child process. When
            this option is `true` then the module will wait for both processes
            to finish before returning.
            This should not be required for most installers and setting to
            `true` could result in the module not returning until the process
            it is waiting for has been stopped manually.
            Requires Windows Server 2012 or Windows 8 or newer to use.
        :param url_method:
            The HTTP Method of the request.
        :param follow_redirects:
            Whether or the module should follow redirects.
            `all` will follow all redirect.
            `none` will not follow any redirect.
            `safe` will follow only "safe" redirects, where "safe" means that
            the client is only doing a `GET` or `HEAD` on the URI to which it
            is being redirected.
            When following a redirected URL, the `Authorization` header and
            any credentials set will be dropped and not redirected.
        :param headers:
            Extra headers to set on the request.
            This should be a dictionary where the key is the header name and
            the value is the value for that header.
        :param http_agent:
            Header to identify as, generally appears in web server logs.
            This is set to the `User-Agent` header on a HTTP request.
        :param maximum_redirection:
            Specify how many times the module will redirect a connection to an
            alternative URI before the connection fails.
            If set to `0` or *follow_redirects* is set to `none`, or `safe`
            when not doing a `GET` or `HEAD` it prevents all redirection.
        :param url_timeout:
            Specifies how long the request can be pending before it times out
            (in seconds).
            Set to `0` to specify an infinite timeout.
        :param validate_certs:
            If `False`, SSL certificates will not be validated.
            This should only be used on personally controlled sites using
            self-signed certificates.
        :param client_cert:
            The path to the client certificate (.pfx) that is used for X509
            authentication. This path can either be the path to the `pfx` on
            the filesystem or the PowerShell certificate path
            `Cert:\\CurrentUser\\My\\<thumbprint>`.
            The WinRM connection must be authenticated with `CredSSP` or
            `become` is used on the task if the certificate file is not
            password protected.
            Other authentication types can set *client_cert_password* when the
            cert is password protected.
        :param client_cert_password:
            The password for *client_cert* if the cert is password protected.
        :param force_basic_auth:
            By default the authentication header is only sent when a
            webservice responses to an initial request with a 401 status.
            Since some basic auth services do not properly send a 401, logins
            will fail.
            This option forces the sending of the Basic authentication header
            upon the original request.

            An explicit proxy to use for the request.
            By default, the request will use the IE defined proxy unless

            The username to use for proxy authentication.

            The module will only have access to the user's credentials if

            The `$ErrorActionPreference` to set before executing *script*.
            `silently_continue` will ignore any errors and exceptions raised.
            `continue` is the default behaviour in PowerShell, errors are
            present in the *error* return value but only terminating
            exceptions will stop the script from continuing and set it as
            failed.

            Both the remote PowerShell and the one specified by *executable*
            must be running on PowerShell v5.1 or newer.

            Parameters to pass into the script as key value pairs.

            The message to be broadcast to users logged on the host for a
            `reboot` failure action.
            Set to an empty string to remove the message.
        :param failure_reset_period_sec:
            The time in seconds after which the failure action list resets
            back to the start of the list if there are no failures.
            To set this value, *failure_actions* must have at least 1 action
            present.
            Specify `'0xFFFFFFFF'` to set an infinite reset period.
        :param force_dependent_services:
            If `true`, stopping or restarting a service with dependent
            services will force the dependent services to stop or restart also.
            If `false`, stopping or restarting a service with dependent
            services may fail.
        :param load_order_group:
            The name of the load ordering group of which this service is a
            member.
            Specify an empty string to remove the existing load order group of
            a service.
        :param name:
            Name of the service.
            If only the name parameter is specified, the module will report on
            whether the service exists or not without making any changes.
        :param path:
            The path to the executable to set for the service.
        :param password:
            The password to set the service to start as.
            This and the `username` argument should be supplied together when
            using a local or domain account.
            If omitted then the password will continue to use the existing
            value password set.
            If specifying `LocalSystem`, `NetworkService`, `LocalService`, the
            `NT SERVICE`, or a gMSA this field can be omitted as those
            accounts have no password.
        :param pre_shutdown_timeout_ms:
            The time in which the service manager waits after sending a
            preshutdown notification to the service until it proceeds to
            continue with the other shutdown actions.
        :param required_privileges:
            A list of privileges the service must have when starting up.
            When set the service will only have the privileges specified on
            its access token.
            The *username* of the service must already have the privileges
            assigned.
            The existing privileges will be replace with the list defined in
            the task if there is a mismatch with any of them.
            Set to an empty list to remove all required privileges, otherwise
            an omitted or null value will keep the existing privileges.
            See `privilege text constants
            <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/privilege-constants>`__
            for a list of privilege constants that can be used.
        :param service_type:
            The type of service.
            The default type of a new service is `win32_own_process`.
            *desktop_interact* can only be set if the service type is
            `win32_own_process` or `win32_share_process`.
        :param sid_info:
            Used to define the behaviour of the service's access token groups.
            `none` will not add any groups to the token.
            `restricted` will add the `NT SERVICE\\<service name>` SID to the
            access token's groups and restricted groups.
            `unrestricted` will add the `NT SERVICE\\<service name>` SID to
            the access token's groups.
        :param start_mode:
            Set the startup type for the service.
            A newly created service will default to `auto`.
        :param state:
            The desired state of the service.
            `started`/`stopped`/`absent`/`paused` are idempotent actions that
            will not run commands unless necessary.
            `restarted` will always bounce the service.
            Only services that support the paused state can be paused, you can
            check the return value `can_pause_and_continue`.
            You can only pause a service that is already started.
            A newly created service will default to `stopped`.
        :param update_password:
            When set to `always` and *password* is set, the module will always
            report a change and set the password.
            Set to `on_create` to only set the password if the module needs to
            create the service.
            If *username* was specified and the service changed to that
            username then *password* will also be changed if specified.
            The current default is `on_create` but this behaviour may change
            in the future, it is best to be explicit here.
        :param username:
            The username to set the service to start as.
            Can also be set to `LocalSystem` or `SYSTEM` to use the SYSTEM
            account.
            A newly created service will default to `LocalSystem`.
            If using a custom user account, it must have the
            `SeServiceLogonRight` granted to be able to start up. You can use
            the :meth:`ansible.windows.win_user_right` module to grant this
            user right for you.
            Set to `NT SERVICE\\service name` to run as the NT SERVICE account
            for that service.
            This can also be a gMSA in the form `DOMAIN\\gMSA$`.

        :param server_selection:
            Defines the Windows Update source catalog.
            `default` Use the default search source. For many systems default
            is set to the Microsoft Windows Update catalog. Systems
            participating in Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) or similar
            corporate update server environments may default to those managed
            update sources instead of the Windows Update catalog.
            `managed_server` Use a managed server catalog. For environments
            utilizing Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) or similar
            corporate update servers, this option selects the defined
            corporate update source.
            `windows_update` Use the Microsoft Windows Update catalog.

            Controls whether found updates are downloaded or installed or
            listed.
            This module also supports Ansible check mode, which has the same
            effect as setting state=searched.

            If an available update does match one of the entries, then it is
            skipped and not installed.
            Each entry can either be the KB article or Update title as a regex
            according to the PowerShell regex rules.

        :param status_code:
            A valid, numeric, HTTP status code that signifies success of the
            request.
            Can also be comma separated list of status codes.
        :param url_method:
            The HTTP Method of the request.
        :param url_timeout:
            Specifies how long the request can be pending before it times out
            (in seconds).
            Set to `0` to specify an infinite timeout.
        :param follow_redirects:
            Whether or the module should follow redirects.
            `all` will follow all redirect.
            `none` will not follow any redirect.
            `safe` will follow only "safe" redirects, where "safe" means that
            the client is only doing a `GET` or `HEAD` on the URI to which it
            is being redirected.
            When following a redirected URL, the `Authorization` header and
            any credentials set will be dropped and not redirected.
        :param headers:
            Extra headers to set on the request.
            This should be a dictionary where the key is the header name and
            the value is the value for that header.
        :param http_agent:
            Header to identify as, generally appears in web server logs.
            This is set to the `User-Agent` header on a HTTP request.
        :param maximum_redirection:
            Specify how many times the module will redirect a connection to an
            alternative URI before the connection fails.
            If set to `0` or *follow_redirects* is set to `none`, or `safe`
            when not doing a `GET` or `HEAD` it prevents all redirection.
        :param validate_certs:
            If `False`, SSL certificates will not be validated.
            This should only be used on personally controlled sites using
            self-signed certificates.
        :param client_cert:
            The path to the client certificate (.pfx) that is used for X509
            authentication. This path can either be the path to the `pfx` on
            the filesystem or the PowerShell certificate path
            `Cert:\\CurrentUser\\My\\<thumbprint>`.
            The WinRM connection must be authenticated with `CredSSP` or
            `become` is used on the task if the certificate file is not
            password protected.
            Other authentication types can set *client_cert_password* when the
            cert is password protected.
        :param client_cert_password:
            The password for *client_cert* if the cert is password protected.
        :param force_basic_auth:
            By default the authentication header is only sent when a
            webservice responses to an initial request with a 401 status.
            Since some basic auth services do not properly send a 401, logins
            will fail.
            This option forces the sending of the Basic authentication header
            upon the original request.
        :param url_username:
            The username to use for authentication.
        :param url_password:
            The password for *url_username*.
        :param use_default_credential:
            Uses the current user's credentials when authenticating with a
            server protected with `NTLM`, `Kerberos`, or `Negotiate`
            authentication.
            Sites that use `Basic` auth will still require explicit
            credentials through the *url_username* and *url_password* options.
            The module will only have access to the user's credentials if
            using `become` with a password, you are connecting with SSH using
            a password, or connecting with WinRM using `CredSSP` or
            `Kerberos with delegation`.
            If not using `become` or a different auth method to the ones
            stated above, there will be no default credentials available and
            no authentication will occur.
        :param use_proxy:
            If `False`, it will not use the proxy defined in IE for the
            current user.
        :param proxy_url:
            An explicit proxy to use for the request.
            By default, the request will use the IE defined proxy unless
            *use_proxy* is set to `False`.
        :param proxy_username:
            The username to use for proxy authentication.
        :param proxy_password:
            The password for *proxy_username*.
        :param proxy_use_default_credential:
            Uses the current user's credentials when authenticating with a
            proxy host protected with `NTLM`, `Kerberos`, or `Negotiate`
            authentication.
            Proxies that use `Basic` auth will still require explicit
            credentials through the *proxy_username* and *proxy_password*
            options.
            The module will only have access to the user's credentials if
            using `become` with a password, you are connecting with SSH using
            a password, or connecting with WinRM using `CredSSP` or
            `Kerberos with delegation`.
            If not using `become` or a different auth method to the ones
            stated above, there will be no default credentials available and
            no proxy authentication will occur.
